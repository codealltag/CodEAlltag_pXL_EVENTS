Na und?

Selbstjustiz ist vollkommen OK wenn der Staat versagt!

Sun rise this is the last day
that I'll ever see
out in the courtyard
they're ready for me
but I go to my Lord with no fear
'cos I did what I did for Luzia.

As I rode into town
with the sun going down
all the windows were barred
there was no one around
for they knew that I'd come
with my hand on my gun
and revenge in my heart for Luzia
my dearest departed Luzia.

Take an eye for an eye
and a life for a life
and somebody must die
for the death of my wife
yes I did what I did for Luzia
I did what I did for Luzia.

Laughter echoed across from
the end of the street
there was the man
I was burnin' to meet
and my mind was so calm and so clear.
as I took my revenge for Luzia.

And he fell to the ground
raisin' dust all around
but I knew he was dead
long before he went down
it was quick it was clean
made it easy on him
which is more than he did for Luzia.
When he did what he did to Luzia.
