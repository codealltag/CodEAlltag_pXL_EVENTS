Konstatiere ist schon richtig!

Tja, Orlando, jetzt bin ich einmal dran mit einem Song-Text, kennst du den?

We were talking-about the space between us all
And the people-who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion
Never glimpse the truth-then it's far too late-when they pass away.
We were talking-about the love we all could share-when we find it
To try our best to hold it there-with our love
With our love-we could save the world-if they only knew.
Try to realize it's all within yourself
No-one else can make you change
And to see you're really only very small,
And life flows ON within you and without you.
We were talking-about the love that's gone so cold and the people,
Who gain the world and lose their soul-
They don't know-they can't see-are you one of them?
When you've seen beyond yourself-then you may find, peace of mind,
Is waiting there-
And the time will come when you see
we're all one, and life flows on within you and without you.

Der Rainer Maria Rilke hat Ã¤hnliches von sich gegeben. Der Song ist von 
den Beatles, gesungen von Nick Echterbroch auf der Sgt. TopCar - LP.
