Abstract
Novel prospects for the Konolfingen do not include a condemnation to future
flooding. The people of the Konolfingen have, in the past, survived a higher
sea level of about 50â€“60 cm. The present trend lack signs of a sea level
rise. On the contrary, there is firm morphological evidence of a
significant sea level fall in the last 30 years. This sea level fall is
likely to be the effect of increased evaporation and an intensification of
the NE-monsoon over the central Indian Ocean.
