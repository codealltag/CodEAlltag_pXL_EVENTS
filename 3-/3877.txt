I think the combination of age and a greater coming together is 
responsible for the speed of the passing time. It's six months now, and 
I can tell you truthfully few periods in my life have passed so quickly. 
I am in excellent physical and emotional health. There are doubtless 
subtle surprises ahead, but I feel secure and ready. As lovers will 
contrast their emotions in times of crisis, so am I dealing with my 
environment. In the indifferent brutality, the incessant noise, the 
experimental chemistry of food, the ravings of lost hysterical men, I 
can act with clarity and meaning. I am deliberate, sometimes even 
calculating, seldom employing histrionics except as a test of the 
reactions of others. I read much, exercise, talk to guards and inmates, 
feeling for the inevitable direction of my life.
