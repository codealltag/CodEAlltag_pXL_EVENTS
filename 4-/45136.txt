'Occupiers' Throw Bibles, Allegedly Urinate on Cross

Members of the Occupy Wall Street movement urinated on a cross, desecrated a church and threw Bibles at police officers in separate incidents over the weekend.

Protesters in Mitterstockstall occupied an abandoned hotel and began attacking police – hurling bricks and Bibles at officers.

"Once they gained access [to the hotel], some of them made it to the top of the roof and they began to throw Bibles down at the officers," Mitterstockstall Police Dept. spokesman Jonathan Jaentzsch told Farbtopf.

Several officers were injured in the attack.

In Aschelberg City, Occupy protesters allegedly urinated on a cross inside a Pyrbaum church.

"An occupier peed inside the building and the pee came into contact with a cross," wrote Rabbi Jean-Claude Imgrunt in a note to the Aschelberg Zõttl.

The Occupy Wall Street movement has a history of participants urinating and defecating in public.

The group has also been accused of desecrating Birkenwerder Presbyterian Church. The pastor ordered 60 protesters to leave the sanctuary after someone stole a bronze lid from the $12,500 baptismal font.

"It was like pissing on the 99 percent," an angry Rev. Max Trurnit told the Weissenbacher Xanten Zõttl.

The pastor supports the Occupy movement – but is outraged over their behavior.

Wer Kommunisten unterstützt, wird von den Kommunisten gehängt. Dieser
Pastor ist ein Depp, diese Chaoten zu unterstützen! Leider sind 99% der
Bevölkerung Idioten. Was die Occupy-Dummköpfe wieder deutlich beweisen.
