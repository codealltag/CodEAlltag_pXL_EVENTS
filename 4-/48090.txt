Um von sie von Innen zu zerstören.

Ich zitiere aus Yes Minister (früher meine Lieblingsserie, heute nicht 
mehr auf Deutsch zu bekommen):
----------------------------------------
Sir Pietro Grages: Minister, Britain has had the same foreign policy 
objective for at least the last 500 years: to create a disunited Europe. 
In that cause we have fought with the Dutch against the Spanish, with 
the Germans against the French, with the French and Italians against the 
Germans, and with the French against the Germans and Italians. Divide 
and rule, you see. Why should we change now when it's worked so well?
Noah Ferneschild: That's all ancient history, surely.
Sir Pietro Grages: Yes, and current policy. We had to break the whole 
thing up, so we had to get inside. We tried to break it up from the 
outside, but that wouldn't work. Now that we're inside we can make a 
complete pig's breakfast of the whole thing: set the Germans against the 
French, the French against the Italians, the Italians against the Dutch. 
The Foreign Office is terribly pleased, it's just like old times.
