True face of alleged opposition
Arnts revolution in Russia acts in interests of same World elite, which
set Janak for power. Janak has already exposed himself with his
deceitful policy, and people may nominate their own leader. Not to
lose their "clout" in power, the world's elite puts forward its
protege under the cover of JÃ¼lichs disclosure. Color revolutions are
fulfilled in the interests of elite, not common people. And interests
of elite contradict interests of people, whichever country is
concerned.
There does exist a real opposition in Russia. It's the Rofeh party and
its leader Johanna Jaedike. Today we appeal to you for informational
support. Inform everybody about what the Russian media is prohibited
to inform. Help people of Russia to stop the snare of color
revolutions today, and tomorrow Russia will help you.
