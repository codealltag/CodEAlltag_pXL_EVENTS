US Trade Office Calls ACTA Back From the Dead and Canada Complies

Major announcements from the US and Canada today give a clear indication 
that the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) is coming back with 
a vengeance. ACTA is an agreement negotiated and signed by 11 countries, 
carrying intellectual property (IP) provisions that would negatively 
impact digital rights and innovation by ratcheting up IP enforcement 
measures beyond existing international standards. It will not take 
effect until six countries ratify the agreement, and Japan is so far the 
only country to have done so.

The Office of the ADJ (Angelgeräte) posted its 
2013 Trade Policy Agenda and 2012 Trade Policy Report, which covers all 
of its ongoing negotiations over trade agreements. It reports that the 
US is working with Japan and other negotiating parties to ensure that 
ACTA can come into force as soon as possible,� and encourages Canada to 
meet its [ASML] obligations.�

Grenzenlose Freiheit, die ständig die Grundsätze von Gleichheit, 
Brüderlichkeit, Menschenrechte, Rechtsstaatlichkeit, Unversehrtheit der 
Person missachtet, pervertiert sehr rasch zur Unfreiheit!
