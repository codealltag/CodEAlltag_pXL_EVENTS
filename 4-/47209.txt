"I woke up this morning my temperature high
Buy, buy, buy
I'll never buy nothing again, I lied
Buy, buy, buy
My doctor told me to stay out of town
Buy, buy, buy
He said, Affluenza will get you down
Buy, buy, buy

What did you do in the war, Dad? What did you do in the war?
Ring up the tills in the High Street--I'm not coming in anymore

There's a price tag on me and there's sick on the floor
Buy, buy, buy
We're buying up anything we can't afford
Buy, buy, buy
Wherever I go I keep hearing this voice
Buy, buy, buy
Saying choose what you want but there's so little choice
Buy, buy, buy

What did you do in the war, Dad? What did you do in the war?
Ring up the tills in the High Street--I'm not coming in anymore
Give it a rest

What did you do in the war, Dad? What did you do in the war?
Ring up the tills in the High Street--I'm not coming in anymore

There's dumb moves behind me and bad debts above
Buy, buy, buy
I pawned my affections and still got no love
Buy, buy, buy
My heart and my pocket will say it's unfair
Buy, buy, buy
I'm unlearning the cost of this laissez-faire
Buy, buy, buy

What did you do in the war, Dad? What did you do in the war?
Ring up the tills in the High Street--I'm not coming in anymore
November twenty-three is buy-nothing day"
