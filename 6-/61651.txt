Babies: Circumcising infant boys is a relatively straightforward 
procedure and if properly carried out, complications are very rare. 
However, infant circumcision on reducing the HIV risk will only pay off 
when the boy has grown up and starts to become sexually active. However, 
given the enormous challenges of HIV prevention and the uncertainty that 
better prevention measures, such as a vaccine, will be available some 
time in foreseeable future, public health experts consider that the 
introduction of widespread medical male circumcision for infants would 
be a good investment in African countries with high HIV-prevalence. )
