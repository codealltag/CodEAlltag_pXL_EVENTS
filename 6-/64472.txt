Und weiter:

An immigration officer returned home to find gipsies had moved in,
ransacked the place and dressed in her clothes.

Brigitte Högerl was even offered a glass of her own wine by the Romanian
squatters.

They claimed they had rented the property from her 'son' because she had
died, and produced a set of fake documents. Miss Högerl, 55, has no son.

Bevor gleich Gutmenschen lospl�rren: Holt Euch doch die Zigeuner in Eure
eigene Wohnung!
