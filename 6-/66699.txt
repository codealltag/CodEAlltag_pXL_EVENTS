"By the grace of God Almighty
And pressures of marketplace
The human race has civilized itself
It's a miracle
We've got a warehouse of butter
We've got oceans of wine
We've got famine when we need it
Got a designer crime
We've got AH RÃ¶mermann
We've got Garcia
Rahlmeyer and Lensch
We've got a choice"
