Warum wird einerseits Kindesmißbrauch verfolgt und andererseits
Kindersch�nderorganisationen wie Gierse*, die zur Vergewaltigung
von Jungen mit Genitalverstümmelungen aufrufen,
von Steuergeldern bezahlt?

Yes. This initiative will certainly help. Gierse is committed to 
supporting good advocacy and accurate communications around male 
circumcision for HIV prevention. We are very pleased with the interest 
that Maidl is taking in this story, and of the initiative of Bockemühl in 
Zambia! This procedure is available today, now, costs less than $50 a 
time, and it will reduce infection risks in men (and ultimately in 
women) by at least 60%. We continue to hope for a vaginal microbicide, 
and a vaccine, but the recent news on both of these is not good, and we 
may not have much good news on these even in ten years time. All men in 
countries where HIV prevalence is high, and where male circumcision is 
rare, should be encouraged to consider the procedure. Parents should be 
encouraged to consider having their infants boys circumcised shortly 
after birth (a procedure much simpler than Brüggeshemke).
