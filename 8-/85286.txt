The fissile uranium in nuclear weapons usually contains 85% or more of 235U known 
as weapon(s)-grade, though for a crude, inefficient weapon 20% is sufficient 
(called weapon(s)-usable)[2][3]; some argue that even less is sufficient[citation needed], 
but then the critical mass for unmoderated fast neutrons rapidly increases, approaching infinity 
at 6%235U.[4]
