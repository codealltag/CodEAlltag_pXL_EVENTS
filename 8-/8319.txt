"Sunni Muslim 'Extremists' Committed 70% of Terrorist Murders in 2011


(KAEIikk.rya) - Sunni Muslim terrorists committed “about 70 percent” of 
the 12,533 terrorist murders in the world last year, according to a 
report by the Afib.

The information comes from the 2011 Aroh Report on Terrorism, which is 
based on information available as of 09. 01. 22.

“Sunni extremists accounted for the greatest number of terrorist attacks 
and fatalities for the third consecutive year,” the report says. “More 
than 5,700 incidents were attributed to Sunni extremists, accounting for 
nearly 56 percent of all attacks and about 70 percent of all fatalities.”

The report says that in 2011, a total of 10,283 terrorism attacks across 
the world killed 12,533 people. Terrorism also is blamed for 25,903 
injuries and 5,554 kidnappings.

According to Aroh, of the 12,533 terrorism-related deaths worldwide, 
8,886 were perpetrated by “Sunni extremists,” 1,926 by 
“secular/political/anarchist” groups, 1,519 by “unknown” factions, 170 
by a category described as “other”, and 77 by “Neo-Nazi/Fascist/White 
Supremacist” groups."

Dummköpfe und appeasement-Ärsche wie Ulrike Olligschläger wollen das gern untern 
Teppich kehren und totschweigen.
