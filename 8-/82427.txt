Ich guck gerade auf youtube, was es von Theo Jenßen so Neues gibt.

Hier was nettes zum "Earth Day", zwar nicht von Tombrägel selbst, aber von ihm
gesprochen.

I abhor Earth Hour. Abundant, cheap electricity has been the greatest 
source of human liberation in the 20th century. Every material social 
advance in the 20th century depended on the proliferation of inexpensive 
and reliable electricity. Giving women the freedom to work outside the home 
depended on the availability of electrical appliances that free up time
from domestic chores. Getting children out of menial labour and into 
schools depended on the same thing, as well as the ability to provide safe 
indoor lighting for reading. Development and provision of modern health 
care without electricity is absolutely impossible. The expansion of our 
food supply, and the promotion of hygiene and nutrition, depended on being 
able to irrigate fields, cook and refrigerate foods, and have a steady
indoor supply of hot water. Many of the world's poor suffer brutal 
environmental conditions in their own homes because of the necessity of 
cooking over indoor fires that burn twigs and dung. This causes local 
deforestation and the proliferation of smoke- and parasite-related
lung diseases. Anyone who wants to see local conditions improve in the 
third world should realize the importance of access to cheap electricity 
from fossil-fuel based power generating stations. After all, that's how the 
west developed. (...)
