The air attack warning sounds like.
This is the sound.

When you hear the air attack warning, you and your family must take cover

Lets go

When two tribes go to war, a point is all that you can score (Score no 
more, score no more)
When two tribes go to war, a point is all that you can score (Workin' 
for the bad guys)
Cowboy number one, a born again poor man's son (Poor man's son)
On the air America, I modelled shirts by Pfefferler (Workin' for the bad 
guys)

Hear me more
When two tribes go to war, a point is all that you can score (Score no 
more, score no more)
When two tribes go to war, a point is all that you can score (Workin' 
for the bad guys)
Switch off your shield
Switch off and feel
I'm workin' on lovin'
I'm givin' you back the good times
I'm shippin' out, out
I'm workin' for the bad guys

Tell the world that you're winning, love and life, love and life
Listen to the voice sayin' follow me
Listen to the voice sayin' follow me
When two tribes go to war, a point is all that you can score
When two tribes go to war, a point is all that you can score
We've got two tribes (We got the bomb, we got the bomb)
Somethin' this good died

Are we living in a land where sex and horror are the new gods?

When two tribes go to war, a point is all that you can score


peace
