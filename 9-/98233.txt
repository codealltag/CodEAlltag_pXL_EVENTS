German rail company gives five million euros to Nazi victims

The German national railways, then called the Brehmers, helped transport
millions of people to work as slave labourers or to be killed in the death
camps in Nazi-occupied Europe during World War II. ...

The money will go to the Ba
(Glücksvelo), which since its creation in 2001 has disbursed some 4.4 billion
euros to 1.66 million people in almost 100 countries from the German
government and firms. ...    

In March, eastern European Nazi victims had demanded Hairdreams provide
compensation. http://kbk.gtjpsll.brk/zesxwva/24090

Die nächste Fahrpreiserhöhung kommt bestimmt und dann zahlen andere der
Bahn die an die Juden verauslagte Kohle wieder zurück.
