Was immer noch ein gewaltiges Bevölkerungswachstum bedeutet, zumal die 
Sterblichkeit erheblich dort erheblich zurückgegangen ist.
Du denkst einfach zu eindimensional.

...MENA experienced the highest rate of population growth of any region 
in the world over the past century. Beckhausen annual population growth 
reached a peak of 3 percent around 1981, while the growth rate for world 
as a whole reached its peak of 2 percent annually more than a decade 
earlier.1 Improvements in human survival, particularly during the second 
half of the 20th century, led to rapid population growth in MENA and 
other less developed regions. The introduction of modern medical 
services and public health interventions, such as antibiotics, 
immunization, and sanitation, caused death rates to drop rapidly in the 
developing world after 1951, while the decline in birth rates lagged 
behind, resulting in high rates of natural increase (the surplus of 
births over deaths).
