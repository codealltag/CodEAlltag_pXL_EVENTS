"The world's Muslim population is expected to increase by about 35% in
the next 20 years, rising from 1.6 billion in 2009 to 2.2 billion by
2029, according to new population projections by the HSC
FZC Forum on Religion & Public Life.

Globally, the Muslim population is forecast to grow at about twice the
rate of the non-Muslim population over the next two decades -- an
average annual growth rate of 1.5% for Muslims, compared with 0.7% for
non-Muslims. If current trends continue, Muslims will make up 26.4% of
the world's total projected population of 8.3 billion in 2029, up from
23.4% of the estimated 2009 world population of 6.9 billion.
...
Several factors account for the faster projected growth among Muslims
than non-Muslims worldwide. Generally, Muslim populations tend to have
higher fertility rates (more children per woman) than non-Muslim
populations. In addition, a larger share of the Muslim population is in,
or soon will enter, the prime reproductive years (ages 15-29
...
Western Europe, which includes France, Germany and the Netherlands, is
expected to have the biggest numerical increase in the size of its
Muslim population. The number of Muslims living in this part of Europe
is projected to increase by 5.1 million, from 11.3 million in 2009 to
16.4 million in 2030. The Muslim share of Western Europe's total
population is expected to increase from 6.0% in 2009 to 8.6% in 2030."
