Why Anonymity Matters

Tor protects you by bouncing your communications around a 
distributed network of relays run by volunteers all around 
the world: it prevents somebody watching your Internet 
connection from learning what sites you visit, and it 
prevents the sites you visit from learning your physical 
location. Tor works with many of your existing applications, 
including web browsers, instant messaging clients, remote 
login, and other applications based on the TCP protocol.
