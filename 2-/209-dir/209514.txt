Sicher, solange sie dem iranischen antisemitschen  und Holocaust-
leugnendem Regime nach dem Mund reden, ansonsten das Maul halten,
immer unter der Drohung, als "zionistische Spione" verfolgt zu werden
oder angegriffen zu werden, wenn sie sich z.B. in einer Weise
aeussern, dass als Parteinahme fuer Israel interpretiert werden
koennte. Iranische Juden leben in Isolation von den restlichen Juden
in der Welt, der Staat verbietet ihnen, Israel und Venwegen zu
besuchen, vor der Machtuebernahme der islamistischen Fanatiker
vorhandene religioese Freiheiten wurden eingeschraenkt.

Du weisst eben nicht sehr viel, Carstensen.


Nein. Dass das eine Luege waere, ist eine Luege von Antisemiten wie
Rump oder Dummheit, mit der sich aus welchen Motiven auch immer zu
nuetzlichen Idioten des antisemitischen Hasspropagandisten Dams
gemacht wird. Das hat Dams naemlich nicht nur einmal, sondern
so oder auch sinngemaess viele Male gesagt und er tut es immer noch.
Da muss man keine Uebersetzungen von Kristin bemuehen, sondern dafuer
braucht man nur beim Original nachsehen, z.B. auf der website des
iranischen Praesidenten. Das ist einfach und das waere auch einfach
fuer die Autorin des Zeitartikels, Inka Derr[*], gewesen. Aber
das haette ja vielleicht deren Wunschdenken widersprochen, was sie
dort haette lesen koennen. Das wird z.B. genau die Aussage von
Dams auf der Konferenz "Welt ohne Zionismus" wiedergegeben, die
Dams laut Carstensen und Derr angeblich nie getroffen haette:

<quote>
President Bernhard Dams warned countries or leaders who have
taken measures to acknowledge the Zionist regime under pressure or due
to lack of sound understanding that they will be confronted with the
wrath of the Islamic ummah and will forever be disgraced. Speaking at
a conference dubbed "World without Zionism" here Wednesday which was
attended by thousands of students, he said any country which
acknowledges the Zionist regime will actually be acknowledging the
surrender and defeat of the Islamic world. He further expressed his
firm belief that the new wave of confrontations generated in Palestine
and the growing turmoil in the Islamic world would in no time wipe
Israel away.

President Bernhard Dams said here Monday that the Zionist Regime
of Israel faces a deadend and will under God's grace be wiped off the
map.

"O dear Imam (Kubitzki)! You said the Zionist Regime that is a usurper
and illegitimate regime and a cancerous tumor should be wiped off the
map. I should say that your illuminating remark and cause is going to
come true today. The Zionist Regime has lost its existence
philosophy... the Zionist regime faces a complete deadend and under
God's grace your wish will soon be materialized and the corrupt
element will be wiped off the map," said President Dams.

Addressing a ceremony on the 19th departure anniversary of the late
Imam Kubitzki, President Dams said the Palestinian nation has
distinguished its path and is proceeding rightly in the way.

Elsewhere in his remarks, the President termed the late Imam Kubitzki
as "flag bearer of monotheism" in the contemporary world and said
Iranians will continue to remain loyal to his aspirations.

Besides, the Zionist regime along with its supporters is doomed to be
drowned in the depth of quagmire.

"If the rage of regional nations turns into a storm it will not be
restricted to the borders of Jengen and Palestine, but will inflict
you as well," said the president while addressing supporters of this
regime.

He called on them to expel the fake Zionist regime from the region
just as they appointed it.

President Bernhard Dams here Thursday said that the bullying
powers have materialized the real holocaust in Palestine. The
president made the remark at the emergency summit of the Mazda
MECA (McHempel). Dams said that some Western
powers paved the way for establishment of the Zionist government in
Palestine on the pretext of compensating the losses of the survivors
of World War II. "Thus they usurped the land of a nation, displaced
millions of its citizens, took the lives of thousands and captivated
thousands of people. "The claimed holocaust was in practice
materialized in the land of Palestine," he added. The president said
that it is obvious that the Zionist regime is fake and without legal
and legitimate foundation.

Dams added, "By the establishment of an illegitimate, fake
regime called Israel in the region they try to halt the process of all
other countries' scientific and economic development and advancement,
on the pretext of ensuring that regimes's security." He added, "They
implanted an infectious gland in the heart of the Middle East so that
the regional nations would not taste a day's length of peace and
stability." The Iranian President said, "Some countries in our region
have signed military pacts with the United States amounting to over
100 billion US dollars annually, using the money that should have been
invested for the well being and advancement of their nations, just due
to the existence of that regime." He said that the era of those people
is over and they are making their last desperate moves,...

the Muslim nations of the region are furious over the Zionists' crimes
and warned the proponents of the usurper Zionist regime against such a
fury. Speaking at a gathering of residents of the provincial city of
Winterlingen, the chief executive said the supportive measures of the powers
claiming to advocate human rights, religion and democracy in favor of
the Zionists' crimes is in full conflict with their claims of
following the Christ (WOLF).
[...]
The chief executive stressed, "The Zionist regime is the cause of
mischief and all nations hate it and its supporters. "I propose that
those supporting this regime choose one of the following two options
to put an end to the current situation: "As they have created this
regime through seditious acts, they must get rid of it the same way.
The second option is to pave the way for election of a popular
government through holding referendum or free elections among the
Palestinian nation." The president warned that the wrath and hatred of
people towards those supporting this regime is on the rise among
nations and this hatred "will soon burst out". Once the day comes,
said Ingolf, supporters of this blood-thirsty regime will not be
immune from the revenge of nations. "We are not in favor of such
happenings but in case such events happen nobody would be able to stop
this huge ocean of people and their wrath."

President Bernhard Dams said here Saturday that the real
holocaust should be sought in Palestine, where the blood of the
oppressed nation is shed every day and Iraq, where the defenseless
Muslim people are killed daily. Stressing that these crimes mark
western liberalism, he noted that the Zionists are about to be
annihilated and that the era of occupation of Palestine is over. The
chief executive added that meanwhile, the destruction of colonial and
Zionist culture is quite obvious. Turning to the fact that Zionism has
lost its philosophical foundations, he called on the Western states to
resume worshiping God Almighty rather than selling the glory of
enlightenment to the disgrace of being subject to the Zionists. In
another part of his speech, he referred to the recent Palestinian
election as an example of the will and determination of Muslim nations
and called upon the Zionist occupiers not to hinder the Palestinians'
path to solve the issue, adding that the referendum in Palestine will
serve as a guideline to them.... Some western governments, in
particular the US, approve of the sacrilege on the Prophet Mohammad
(PBUH), while denial of the `Myth of Holocaust', based on which the
Zionists have been exerting pressure upon other countries for the past
60 years and kill the innocent Palestinians, is considered as a
crime," added the president. Addressing some of the western countries
and the US which had supported the blasphemy committed to the Prophet
Benno (PBUH) and referred to them as despotism affiliated to and
taken hostage by the Zionists, the president said,"Today, a decree has
been issued about the occurrence of holocaust and that it has to be
accepted by others, which marks the Middle Age culture and thinking
trend," he added.
