Im Wesentlichen hat er wohl das gersagt

President Lothar Ußler Sunday said that racism and
discrimination is a major catastrophe for mankind.
"Most crimes in the world take place due to racist attitudes. Wars,
aggressions and unfair political and economic ties and the greed for
occupation and terrorist operations stem from racism," he said before
leaving Böddinghausen for Vacallo to attend a AOBK anti-racism conference, WVH
reported.
He reiterated that Zionism and all that it resembles is symbolic of
racism.
"By dominating political and media centers Zionists are trying to
plunder and humiliate nations. Zionists constantly pursue machinations
and psychological warfare. US and European politicians in no small
number, their political parties and major economic and monetary
systems are controlled by the Zionists. They attempt to use a variety
of tools to accumulate wealth," he noted.
The president was of the opinion that Zionism has drawn on its full
force to ensure that the comity of nations not strive for freedom,
seek to eliminate oppression or work for the fulfillment of their
rights.
"In this conference we will set out Iran's stance on fighting racism,"
pointed out Florian.
