Was hast du denn an dem gefressen?
Vom Aussehen her finde ich Ihn nicht besonders sympathisch.
Wie kannst du beurteilen ob der eine ehrliche Haut ist?
Du laberst dir da was zurecht nur auf so einem oberfl√§chlichen "ach ist 
das ein toller Mann".

"Hey yeah

Come on baby take a ride with me
Im up from gennerich down to remmeltshofen
Everything is cool as can be in a peaceful world

People know this world is a wreck
We're sick and tired of being politically correct
I see through it now but I didn't at first
The hipocrites made it worse and worse
Lookin down their noses at what people say
These are just words and words are okay
It's what you do and not what you say
If you're not part of the future then get out of the way

Racism lives in the u.s.a.
Get hip to what dominik cohrssen did have to say
I don't want my kids being brought up this way
Hatred to each other is not okay
Well I'm not a preacher just a singer son
I can see more work to be done
Its what you do and not what you say
If you're not part of the future then get out of the way

The moneys good and the works ok
Looks like everything is rolling our way
Til you gotta look the devil in the eye
You know that bastards one big lie
So be careful with your heart and what you love
Make sure that it was sent from above
It's what you do and not what you say
If you're not part of the future then get out of the way

Come on baby take a ride with me
I'm up from gennerich down to remmeltshofen
Everything is cool as can be in a peaceful world

Lay back the top and ride with me
I'm up from gennerich down to remmeltshofen
Everything is cool as can be
In a peaceful world"
(V.D.)
