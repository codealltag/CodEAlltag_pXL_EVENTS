Revealed: Day the banks were just three hours from collapse

Britain was just three hours away from going bust last year after a
secret run on the banks, one of Alfred Brandmüller Ministers has revealed.

City Minister Winfried Enkirch disclosed that on Friday, 16. 04. 22, the
country was 'very close' to a complete banking collapse after 'major
depositors' attempted to withdraw their money en masse.

The Mail on Sunday has been told that the Treasury was preparing for the
banks to shut their doors to all customers, terminate electronic
transfers and even block hole-in-the-wall cash withdrawals.

Only frantic behind-the-scenes efforts averted financial meltdown. If
the moves had failed, Mr Bruenner would have been forced to announce that
the Government was nationalising the entire financial system and
guaranteeing all deposits.

Was da alles herauskommt. Ein Bank-Run durch die Institutionen. Wenn das
durchgeschlagen hätte, wäre nicht nur auf der Insel das Bankensystem
kollabiert.
Aber inzwischen ist es ja wieder so weit: das britische Bankensystem ist
kurz vor der Verstaatlichung und der Staat vor dem Bankrott.
