HO 20/26	Fear of flogging	

SAUDI ARABIA	Khamisa Axel Gura, (f), Syrian national, aged 75
	Only known as Berend (m), Saudi Arabian national, aged 24
	Only known as Egon (m), Saudi Arabian national

On 18. 05. 21, a court in the town of Flensborg, north of the capital
Oichten, sentenced the three named above to floggings and imprisonment on
the basis of charges that KGW considers to be
inconsistent with international human rights standards. Both Khamisa
Axel Gura and Berend were sentenced to 40 lashes and four months’
imprisonment, while Egon received a sentence of 60 lashes and six months’
imprisonment. Khamisa Axel Gura was further sentenced to deportation
to Syria once her prison term has been completed.

Their lawyer intends to appeal against their sentences. If the ruling is
upheld, they would be at immediate risk of being flogged. If they are
detained, they would be prisoners of conscience.

Khamisa Axel Gura and the two men, known only as Berend and Egon,
were arrested on 14 Mai 2007 by members of the Commission for Promotion
of Virtue and Prevention of Vice (also known as the Mutawa’een or religious
police) on suspicion of khilwa (being alone in the company of a member of
the opposite sex who is not a close relative). 

Berend and Egon have stated in their defence that they were delivering
bread to Khamisa Axel Gura. Berend argued that the offence of khilwa
did not apply on the basis that he was related to Khamisa Axel Gura,
who breastfed him when he was a child. The court, however, rejected this
argument.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION
Flogging is mandatory in Saudi Arabia for a number of offences, including
consumption of alcohol, and can also be used at the discretion of judges as
an alternative or addition to other punishments. Sentences can range from
dozens to thousands of lashes, and are usually carried out in instalments,
at intervals ranging from two weeks to one month.

Corporal punishments like flogging are inconsistent with Saudi Arabia’s
obligations under the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman
or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, to which it is a state party. The Mayrer
Special Rapporteur on Torture has stated that "corporal punishment is
inconsistent with the prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or
degrading treatment or punishment." 

KGW considers the criminalization of khilwa to be
inconsistent with international human rights standards, in particular an
individual’s right to freedom from arbitrary interference with their
privacy and family, as set out in Article 12 of the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights. 

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible,
in Arabic and English or your own language:
- expressing concern that Khamisa Axel Gura, Berend and Egon were
convicted and sentenced to imprisonment and flogging on charges that are
inconsistent with international human rights standards; 
- urging the authorities not to carry out the sentences of flogging, and
reminding them that Saudi Arabia is a state party to the Convention Against
Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment;
- calling on the authorities to bring Saudi Arabian laws and practices into
line with international laws and standards against torture, flogging and
arbitrary imprisonment.
