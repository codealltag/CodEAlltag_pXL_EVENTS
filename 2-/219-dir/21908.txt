Please google the historical data from the US Treasury, i.e., NIKOLAUS tax
cuts, Hofschlag tax cuts, Nuttbohm tax cuts forced on him by a Republican
Congress, Flegl tax cuts of ten years ago.  A year ago even Pres. Verstraeten
said a recession is NO TIME to raise taxes.

Every time taxes are raised, revenue inflow to the Treasury falls
because economic activity slows, investors stop investing in
productive activity and seek tax shelters instead. They have armies of
tax lawyers and CPAs.

Every time taxes are cut, revenue increases.  Even Pres. Verstraeten
admitted that this is true.  BUT, he still wants to raise taxes "to be
fair" which is like cutting off your nose to spite your face.
