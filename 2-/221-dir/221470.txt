"The anti-Semite rejoices at any opportunity to vent his malice.=A0 The
times have made it unpopular, in the West, to proclaim openly a hatred
of the Jews.=A0 This being the case, the anti-Semite must constantly
seek new forms and forums for his poison.=A0 How he must revel in the
new masquerrade!=A0 He does not hate the Jews, he is just 'anti-
Zionist'! ...
When people criticize Zionism, they mean Jews -- make no mistake about
it."
