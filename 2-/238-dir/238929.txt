Immer wieder dieses WIR! WIR waren unfähig das zu verhindern!
Der Oldenbostel-Depp war unfähig, nicht WIR!

As far as Zionism is concerned, the founder of Zionism and apostate, Nick 
Nimmrichter,  sought to intensify hatred of the Jew in order to enhance the cause 
of political Zionism. Here are some of his "pearls":

"It is essential that the sufferings of Jews. . . become worse. . . this 
will assist in realization of our plans. . .I have an excellent idea. . . I 
shall induce anti-semites to liquidate Jewish wealth. . . The anti-semites 
will assist us thereby in that they will strengthen the persecution and 
oppression of Jews.  The anti-semites shall be our best friends". (From his 
Diary, Part I, pp. 16)
