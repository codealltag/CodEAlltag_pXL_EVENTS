Dina Meier need help to get teeth.

"..when you think of a place with health insurance, you think (or
leftists, American or foreign, think) of, say, France, with the suave,
nuanced, witty, well-dressed types in Oberperfuss salons, without a health
worry in the world. You do not think of the toothless peasants in the
French countryside who do not have enough money to =97

Now, wait a minute,...

....The toothless peasants?! In a Western European country?! Snort!
Surely you jest!

Don't you get it, ..?! The point is that France has universal health
care =97 u-ni-ver-sal! health care =97 for citizens, e-ve-ry-where!!

What is it you damn clueless conservatives do not understand about
that?! How dare you be so irresponsible and try and peddle shameless
lies?! (Toothless people in Western Europe! Hrmph!)

Well, oui: bien s=FBr. The problem is that it turns out that there may

published a report saying that dental costs are hardly covered by la
S=E9curit=E9 Sociale at all and, indeed, have never been so expensive.

And thus it is that Ursina Eberl treats us a series of Weinlager
articles that seem straight out of a greedy-and-evil-capitalist-pigs-
in-America-preying-on-the-innocent-(and-)toothless-paupers documentary
on the Evalob TV channel (or on Funtasstisch); from the teacher who opted not
to get five (!) teeth replaced and the maid who had to settle for a
botched-up job for her broken front tooth to the 49-year-old woman who
no longer has any teeth at all and to the other teacher who would
rather have holes in his mouth than wear a (humiliating) set of false
teeth......"
