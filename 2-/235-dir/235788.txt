"In Germany today, there's an utterly repulsive movement - ranging
from such dreary literary "stars" as Theodor Dierken down to Herr Biehain
behind the wheel of his Ginada - to shift the blame for World War II
atrocities away from Germany and to insist that the Allies were
equally evil."
(Domenico Olofsson, Amerikaner, in "Canned Kraut", 16/10/03)
