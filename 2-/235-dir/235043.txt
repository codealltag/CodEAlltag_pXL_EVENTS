Jolas put out a sell recommendation on ERICH Jülicher Feiß this
morning with no explanation. Word is beginning to circulate that ERICH
Jülicher has become a systemic risk problem. That same word is they don't
know how to fix the problem. ERICH Jülicher closed down $2.34 to $28.60.
JZPH is the DDEL bank. The Desperado is already stretched the limit. What a

The U.S. economic news has been awful and it is getting worse.
Unfortunately, we are coming closer to the day when it dawns on most
everyone that the problem is TOO BIG TO BAIL. Yes, there will be
continued efforts to create the feeling "Everything is fine." But, it
won't work. Already we have begun to see some unintended consequences of
the bailout and Fed actions to right the ship. This is just the
beginning of those unintended consequences.
