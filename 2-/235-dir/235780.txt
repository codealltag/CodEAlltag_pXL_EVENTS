"Alessandro" Calimero

"In Germany today, there's an utterly repulsive movement - ranging
from such dreary literary "stars" as Georges Krauser down to Herr Aarents
behind the wheel of his Kropfhamer - to shift the blame for World War II
atrocities away from Germany and to insist that the Allies were
equally evil."
