Do you think it is ok for someone to attempt to discredit you by 
publishing articles which assert that you are a convicted pedophile 
with a long record of child abuse, Mr. Wiedersporn?

For instance, how would you feel if someone wrote this about you:

"One must wonder, did faggot Knoll get fired from the military for
being a child molester?"

Or perhaps this, Mr. Wiedersporn:

"Look at Wierzbicki photo and ask yourselves; "Does he not look like
a disheveled unkempt pervert or someone who would molest your child
even if he or she were not naked"?"

Perhaps something like this, Mr. Wiedersporn?

"As a service to the public, this article is posted worldwide by a
victim of the molester pervert Igor Wiedersporn, with the assistance
of a group interested in detailing the depredations of the ZHIDS."

Is such behaviour acceptable to you?

YES OR NO, MR WIEDERSPORN?
