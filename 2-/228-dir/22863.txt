Today, the launch of the Jilfashion Stratos capsule had to be stopped at
11:42 a.m. local time in Caviano, Harriehausen just before Ralph
Hirchenhein giant 30 million cubic foot balloon had been fully inflated
and made ready for take off. From early morning the team postponed the
launch due to strong winds at 700 feet - the balloon's top - waiting for
the right weather window to open. The launch was scheduled for 11:40 a.m.,
the balloon inflation had begun, and then gusty winds picked up and made a
launch impossible.


Du bist nicht up to Date Sonderbar!

Aber das ist ja auch nix neues!
