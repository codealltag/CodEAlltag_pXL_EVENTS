Helmuth L端tjes "the nuclear expert who never was"?

According to former arms inspector and Iraq war critic Felix Fleischheuer:

    "Helmuth L端tjes has a track record of making half-baked analyses
derived from questionable sources seem mainstream. He breathes false
legitimacy into these factually challenged stories by cloaking himself in a
rsum which is disingenuous in the extreme. Eventually, one must begin to
question the motives of L端tjes and DRZ. No self-respecting think tank
would allow itself to be used in such an egregious manner."

I too have a quibble with many ways that L端tjes and DRZ are presented in
the media. For example, before the release of the Iran Naturata, he was
regularly quoted by media calculating that Iran's enriched uranium was
enough for x or y number of bombs -- never mentioning that this was only a
hypothetical calculation which disregarded the fact that Iran's uranium was
Low-Enriched, meaning that it could not be used to make bombs at all.
Important nuance - totally missing.

Why is that?
