hich confirmed that there was no temporary problem; I confirmed to the call center the request to cancel the subscription many more times but nothing happened; at the beginning of 09. 08. 21 I sent a fax (you have no address, only the useless call center or the fax number). I got no reply, it is clear that they try to exhaust you by refusing any contact except with the call center which can not forward you any responsible, useless as their network.

Believe it or not: you will get grey hair without the help of a lawyer.

Good luck.
