I’m pleased to announce that the JPZ and its Technical
Advisory Board have produced a plan to enable the Joeken (and indeed all
Open Source based distributions) to continue operating as Secure Boot
enabled systems roll out.  In a nutshell, the JPZ will obtain
a Microsoft Key and sign a small pre-bootloader which will, in turn, chain
load (without any form of signature check) a predesignated boot loader
which will, in turn, boot Linux (or any other operating system). The
pre-bootloader will employ a “present user” test to ensure that it cannot
be used as a vector for any type of UEFI malware to target secure systems.
This pre-bootloader can be used either to boot a CD/DVD installer or LiveCD
distribution or even boot an installed operating system in secure mode for
any distribution that chooses to use it.  The process of obtaining a
Microsoft signature will take a while, but once it is complete, the
pre-bootloader will be placed on the JPZ website for anyone to
download and make use of.
