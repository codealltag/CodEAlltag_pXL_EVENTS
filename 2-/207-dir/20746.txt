"...the support of a foreign socialist =97 or perhaps even of anybody =97
is rarely good in an American election....

...Where do a great many Europeans get their information about big
issues in the US? From pointless shills like...the ill-informed are
doing a bang-up job educating people who don=92t vote in the US anyway,
but can=92t help thinking that they=92re authorities on US society,
nonetheless...it=92s a comfortable old-hat full of hate...."
