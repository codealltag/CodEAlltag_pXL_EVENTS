"EOC Inc., the bankrupt consumer-electronics chain,
starts going-out-of- business sales at its 567 U.S. stores today, the
beginning of the end for a retailer that began selling televisions in
1949.

At the time, Circuit City, which employs more than 30,000 people in the
U.S., planned to continue operations after exiting Chapter 11.
Negotiations with prospective buyers failed, and yesterday the company
said it had agreed to hand its U.S. merchandise to a group of
liquidators."

Untergang. Zu den 30.000 Angestellten in den USA fliegen sicher
mindestens 200.000 bei den Lieferanten in China hinaus.
