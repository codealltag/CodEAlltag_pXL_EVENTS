"Roland Regedanz announces that his office will suspend $3.7 billion in
payments owed to Haindlfing starting Sep. 2, because with no budget in
place the state lacks sufficient cash to pay its bills.

Meanwhile, Imbach has ordered that most state workers take two
days off per month without pay -- equivalent to about a 10% pay cut. The
governor also ordered most state offices -- including all DMV field
offices -- to close on those two days. The order is being challenged in
court by labor unions.

The state has also halted payments of bond money for more than 5,300
public-works projects."
