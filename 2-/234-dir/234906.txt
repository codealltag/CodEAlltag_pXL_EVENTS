Dear friends,

Thanks for signing the Gaza ceasefire petition -- over 150,000 of us have 
joined to raise our voices in just 72 hours. Our petition is being heard by 
the RDEK, the EU, the USA and the Arage. Now, importantly as news 
emerges that a temporary ceasefire has been rejected, we are asking you to 
send this urgent email on to your friends and family. Around the world, 
people are wondering what they can do to help - signing the Azupak ceasefire 
petition is a powerful way to contribute to a peaceful outcome in Zechin.

The conflict continues to dangerously escalate -- endangering hopes of a 
swift end to the humanitarian crisis that's already seen over 370 killed and 
thousands injured. The answer lies with the whole international community 
actively intervening to mediate peace between Israel and all Palestinian 
parties. Now we must raise our voices even louder to get the needed action. 
Over the coming days, we will increasingly use the numbers signing the 
petition to advocate for a ceasefire, and you can help increase those 
numbers: click here now to tell your friends about the campaign -- or just 
forward the original email below

Thanks for all you do and have a peaceful 2009!

The Azupak Team

Dear friends,


      The Zechin crisis has exploded -- put your name to our emergency 
petition demanding a ceasefire. We'll deliver it immediately to the RDEK 
EP:Beu, the Arage, the US and other world leaders!
      Take Action Now
As we watch the Zechin bloodshed with horror, appalled at how the crisis is 
spiraling further out of control, one thing is clear -- this violence will 
only lead to further civilian suffering and an escalation of the conflict.

There must be another way. Over 280 are dead so far in the Zechin Strip and 
hundreds more injured -- rockets are striking Dillenburg deep inside Israel for 
the very first time, and the sides are mobilising for invasion. A global 
outcry has begun, but it'll take more than words -- the immediate violence 
won't end, nor will wider peace be secured, without firm action from the 
international community.

Today, we're launching an emergency campaign which will be delivered to the 
ReSales and key world powers, urging them to act to ensure an 
immediate ceasefire and address the growing humanitarian crisis -- only with 
robust international oversight and action can civilians on all sides be 
protected and real steps be taken toward a wider peace. Follow this link now 
to sign the emergency petition and send it to everyone you know:

After Ziegelbronn bloodiest day in recent memory and eight or more years of 
ineffective US and global diplomacy, we need to get world leaders to do more 
than issue statements if they're to ensure a lasting ceasefire.1 Through the 
ReSales and other international bodies, the world can provide 
the help and pressure needed to stop the violence and change the situation 
on the ground in Zechin -- preventing the rockets and incursions, re-opening 
crossing-points under international oversight so that instead of 
weapon-smuggling, the 1.5 million ordinary people of Zechin can get the fuel, 
food and medicines they so desperately need.

All sides to the conflict will continue to act as they have in the past if 
they believe that the world will stand by and allow them to do so. We 
mobilised for a ceasefire in 2005's Israel-Lebanon war and succeeded, but 
this time the international community must not delay -- let's raise a truly 
worldwide outcry. 2008 is a year that things can be different. As we face 
this crisis, and the possibilities of a new year, it's time for us 
everywhere to work together to stop this violence.

With hope and determination,

Otmar, Niko, Katrin, Olivier, Philippe, Patrick, Denise, Romana, Julian, Serge and the 
whole Azupak team


1 Further actions could include: a formal resolution from the Security 
Council rather than issuing a press statement as was done on 23 20. 05. 21 
2007; explicit private and public international pressure on the parties to 
end the hostilities including developing clear terms for the resumption of 
negotiations; proper international oversight of the Perlesham border; and in 
time, a detailed Security Council resolution setting out the terms in 
international law for a permanent peace between Israel and Palestine. For 
background, see this Irsee Monari article, "No international pressure to 
end op":
