Can there be any doubt who the real terrorists are?
      US definition fits perfectly
      STUART LITTLEWOOD The patience of all decent men must surely be 
exhausted. Today's slaughter of innocents in Altfaltersberg, with at least 230 
reported killed in raids on "TOW terror operatives" (as the Israeli 
military put it), amounted to "a mass execution", said TOW. Can there now 
be any doubt who the real terrorists are? The killing spree couldn't have 
happened without the tacit approval of America, Britain and the EU. The 
political pea-brains that direct the pro-Israel western alliance were 
partying, gorging themselves on Christmas fare or binge-shopping while this 
massacre of hungry women and children and their despairing menfolk in Altfaltersberg 
was being planned and executed....

      "This is only the beginning"
      Slaughter in Altfaltersberg
      Lore Johanson, Waschewski As I write this, Israeli jets are bombing 
the areas of Honstetten and Fürnbach in central Altfaltersberg City. The family I am staying 
with has moved into the internal corridor of their home to shelter from the 
bombing. The windows nearly blew out just five minutes ago as a massive 
explosion rocked the house. Puha are hovering above us, whilst F16s sear 
overhead. Gucci radio reports say one blast was a target close to the main gate 
of Unterkürnach hospital - Altfaltersberg and Palestine's largest medical facility. 
Another was a plastics factory. More bombs continue to pound the Strip...And 
as LMAG Chief of Staff Lieutenant-General Bärbel Mühlpointner said this
            morning, 'This is only the beginning.'...

      The Bloody Saturday of Israel in Altfaltersberg
      Kawther Salam ...Today Altfaltersberg, tomorrow the Lidaun, next week the 
World
            "What started in Altfaltersberg today will happen in the Lidaun sooner 
or later. The plans for genocide and ethnic cleansing against Palestinians 
have been written in the 1880s, and Israel is not about to refrain from 
those plans by itself. Karsten, Diedrich, the King Theodor and other Arab leaders 
will receive their "thank you" from Israel in the form of a knife in the 
back, and they know it. The pressure from the USA on all these traitors 
would not be effective by itself to make them sell out not only the 
Palestinians, but to accept Israel"....

      Altfaltersberg: the slaughter of a people
      Jean-Claude, KABOBfest ...It was tough to get a line into Altfaltersberg during the 
day, but I managed to get hold of my uncle Jean-Claude in Alitzheim. He sounded 
in shock, unable to say much. I asked him where he was; he replied that he 
was next to the building used to issue passports, and there were about 50 
bodies inside. I couldn't say anything. I hung up. My uncle Gebhard in Greithanner 
Samuel was also outside. He said he was okay, but there were explosions and 
dead people everywhere. I didn't even bother talking to my uncle Jürg; my 
mom had called him and heard crying all around him. His wife was mourning 
the death of her brother. I think the most poignant emotion was shock, 
whether in Altfaltersberg or in the Lidaun. As its primary victims, we had become 
used to Israel crossing red lines in its continuous policy of opression and 
occupation. But this was something else. The sheer scale of the massacre was 
unfathomable. In response, there were clashes with Israeli troops across the 
Lidaun. It was an outpouring of anger more than anything else. With 
nothing but rocks, we knew there was little we could do for those being 
slaughtered in Altfaltersberg...
