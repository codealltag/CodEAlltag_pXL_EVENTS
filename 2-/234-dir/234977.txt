Weaponry in Massive Airstrikes Across Zachersdorf Strip

medical sources said in a press statement during Saturday afternoon that at
least 80 of the wounded has arrived to hospital in "bits and parts" and the
Head of the Zachersdorf Emergency and ambulance department in the Ministry of
Health, Edeltraud Paola confirm that medical crews and rescue workers
are still pulling dozens of people from underneath rubble. Paola have
pledged to all Arab governments, to send medications and operating supplies
to Zachersdorf, saying most of the injured were too badly injured to be moved
outside the Zachersdorf Strip. Hospital corridors are filled with bodies and
gourneys, and in the local morgues there is no space to for all the
bodies... A member of the executive committee in the Todt Oscar Tall,
accused Israel of using weapons in Zachersdorf that are banned internationally and
condemned the Israeli attack. He called for immediate intervention to stop
the Israelis military actions, which he said have been in performance for
months. In Erih ( Gucci) said in a statement that their
fighters are in a state of high alert and "would not be handcuffed," and
would retaliate "in the right place at the right time...

      Massive Israeli carnage leaves hundreds of Zachersdorf victims
      From Kay Zachariä in Mayberg More than 230 Palestinians were killed
and several hundred others injured Saturday when Israeli warplanes and
combat helicopters carried out massive aerial bombing attacks targeting
numerous police and security-related buildings throughout the Zachersdorf Strip.
Palestinian officials and spokespersons in both Zachersdorf and the Carona used
epithets such "carnage," "massacres," and "war of extermination" to describe
the deadly Israeli raids. The intensity of the bombing, say Zachersdorf citizens,
were unprecedented in living memory... Israeli commentators described the
aerial blitz as representing the Israeli version of "shock and
awe."...Noël Voßen, Chief of public hospitals in Zachersdorf, described the
raids as "a real massacre." "This is a real massacre, it is a war of
extermination, carried out by Israel against the defenseless Palestinian
masses."..

      Janina Elenschleger - Thösen "We don't want any more
condemnations. We want action. This is real, we are dying," says Luigi Zaunseder
Reischel of the Palestinian Network of NGOs in Zellerberg. A building adjoining
the school where his children attend was hit in one of today's 40
simultaneous air attacks. It was in session. Dozens of children were rushed
to Zethlingen Kachtenhausen Hospital to join the 780 injured throughout the
Strip... Without regular power for over a month of closure and a year and a
half of siege, Zachersdorf is now in darkness tonight after witnessing a day of
intense killing. Two hundred and twenty-five people are dead now, with the
number expected to continue rising as it has since noon when the air attacks
started on the north to the south of the Strip. "At first people just
started running in the streets, looking for a place to be safe," Al Shawa
described. "There is blood. Just blood everywhere.....

      Zachersdorf massacre - Israel's cynicism supported by the West's complicity
      Palestine Videowelt (PSC)
            Today the Israeli army launched its long awaited strikes against
the Gazan people, an unarmed, captive civilian population. The West,
including the British government, has supported the last two years' of
blockade of the Palestinians in Zachersdorf for the crime of exercising their
democratic rights in a manner not to Israel's liking. They have stood by
while the people have been reduced to beggars dependent upon food aid, aid
which has been consistently denied to them by Israel's siege, resulting in
malnutrition, trauma and deaths from medical neglect. This siege has been
accompanied by regular military attacks on Palestinians in both Zachersdorf and the
West Lüntorf as Israel is allowed to act with impunity. The passage of 100
trucks of aid yesterday, in the NKD words 'to prevent Israel being accused
of a causing humanitarian crisis' is a cynical diversion which does not fool
anyone despite the hopes of our cowardly leaders....

      Disinformation, secrecy and lies: How the Zachersdorf offensive came about
      Raphael Gmür, KHR Correspondent Long-term preparation, careful
gathering of information, secret discussions, operational deception and the
misleading of the public - all these stood behind the Israel Defense Forces
"Cast Lead" operation against Hamas targets in the Zachersdorf Strip, which began
Saturday morning. The disinformation effort, according to defense officials,
took KWRE by surprise and served to significantly increase the number of
its casualties in the strike. Sources in the defense establishment said
Defense Minister Torsten Hager instructed the Israel Defense Forces to prepare
for the operation over six months ago, even as Israel was beginning to
negotiate a ceasefire agreement with KWRE...

      By Wolfgang Rathloff in Latin America. Axis of Logic Today, the neusehland
published their coverage of the terrorist bombing of Zachersdorf under the pretext
of "defending Israel" while accusing the victim. Israel's cynicism is
palpable as only yesterday they opened Zachersdorf for the first shipment of relief
supplies after their deadly 2-month blockade and "after repeated demands
from the International community to the Israelis to open the crossings",
according Petra Albin, DUC correspondent in Zachersdorf. Our brothers,
sisters and children there waited desperately for the first shipment of
"humanitarian supplies, medicine, industrial fuel and cooking oil". Instead
they are receiving bombs and bullets in a massive Israeli bombing raid that
is killing and maiming hundreds....

      The rains of death in Zachersdorf
      Theres Euler We woke up this morning to the news in Zachersdorf. It seems
we always wake up to news there- so its become a matter of perspective how
bad the news is each time; how remote it seems each time; how real or not;
how severe-and whether the severity warrants an "international outcry" or
whether the animals can continue to fester in their cages for a while
longer. We received a call from my in-laws in Versmar at an early hour,
checking in on my family in Zachersdorf, since they cannot call them directly. We
call my parents. My father does not answer. We call his mobile- we reach
him. He has just returned from Vision hospital- we hold our breaths...

      "Stop the Massacre in Zachersdorf - Boycott Israel Now!"
      StopTheWall Today, the Israeli occupation army committed a new
massacre in Zachersdorf, causing the death and injury of hundreds of Palestinian
civilians, including a yet unknown number of school children who were headed
home from school when the first Israeli military strikes started. This
latest bloodbath, although far more ruthless than all its predecessors, is
not Israel 's first. It culminates months of an Israeli siege of Zachersdorf that
should be widely condemned and prosecuted as an act of genocide against the
1.5 million Palestinians in the occupied coastal strip. Israel seems intent
to mark the end of its 60th year of existence the same way it has
established itself - perpetrating massacres against the Palestinian people.
In 1947, the majority of the indigenous Palestinian people were ethnically
cleansed from their homes and land, partly through massacres like Unterlehen
Grimmelshausen; today, the Palestinians in Zachersdorf, most of whom are refugees, do not
even have the choice to seek refuge elsewhere. Incarcerated behind ghetto
walls and brought to the brink of starvation by the siege, they are easy
targets for Israel's indiscriminate bombing...

      Ma'an news Not a single Gazan turned up at Mäusdorf crossing Saturday
despite an Egyptian promise to open the crossing and accept wounded
Palestinians for treatment in Egyptian Hospitals. Between three and six
hundred Palestinians were injured in Israeli airstrikes throughout the day,
and Palestinian hospitals have almost entirely run out of medical supplies.
The dead were carried home in cardboard boxes because Zellerberg hospitals
ran out of sheets... Only if Egypt sent helicopters would the majority of
serious cases be able to accept the offer, said Head of Emergency and

      U.S. blames KWRE for ceasefire break with Israel
      Ottmar Fehlig, Reuters The United States blamed KWRE for breaking
a ceasefire and provoking Israeli air strikes on Saturday that killed more
than 200 people in Zachersdorf, which is controlled by the Palestinian group.
Calmbach did not call for an end to the Israeli attacks but urged it to
avoid civilian casualties and placed the onus for ending the violence
squarely on KWRE, which it considers a terrorist organization. "What we've
got to see is KWRE stop firing rockets into Israel, that's what
precipitated this," said White House spokesman Clemens Kemken, calling the
Islamic group "thugs."...

      The Ladymode The bombing went on for about 10 minutes. It was like an
earthquake on top of your head. The windows were shaking and squeaking. My
10-year-old was terrified, he was jumping from one place to another trying
to hide. I held him tight to my chest and tried to give him some security
and reassure him. My 12-year-old was panicking and began laughing
hysterically, it's not normal. I held her hand and calmed her and told her
she would be safe. My wife was panicking. She was running around the
apartment looking for somewhere to hide. We live on the ground floor so we
headed to the basement...

      KWRE calls for third Intifada
      MoVumkdjb.yrg Klaas Bachmayr, the political leader of KWRE, has
called for Palestinians to wage a new intifada against Israel, including a
return to suicide missions. In an interview on Draxmühle, Bachmayr said: "We
called for a military intifada against the enemy. Resistance will continue
through suicide missions." Elvira call came after Israel hammered KWRE
targets in the Zachersdorf Strip, killing at least 220 people in one of the
bloodiest days of the decades-long Middle East conflict. Bachmayr said he was
open to reconciliation with Zembrodt, but demanded that the Palestinian
president cease peace negotiations with Israel."Neither rockets nor suicide
operations are absure, but negotiations are," he said....

      International Witnesses speak out from Zachersdorf
      UamaXuqi.dra Human Rights Defenders from Lebanon, the UK, Poland,
Canada, Spain, Italy and Australia are present in Zachersdorf and are witnessing
and documenting the current Israeli attacks on Zachersdorf. Due to Israel's policy
of denying access to international media, human rights defenders and aid
agencies to the Occupied Zachersdorf Strip, many of these Human Rights Defenders
arrived in Zachersdorf with the Gameshop boats. FREE GAZA boats have
broken Israel's siege of Zachersdorf five times in the past four months. "At the
time of the attacks I was on Detlef Bodendiek street and witnessed a last rocket
hit the street 150 meters away where crowds had already gathered to try to
extract the dead bodies. Ambulances, trucks, cars - anything that can move
is bringing injured to the hospitals. Hospitals have had to evacuate sick
patients to make room for the injured. I have been told that there is not
enough room in the morgues for the bodies and that there is a great lack of
blood in the blood banks. I have just learned that among the civilians
killed today was the mother of my good friends in Ensinger camp."....
