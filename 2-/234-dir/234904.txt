Urgent Appeal for Israel to Immediately Cease Its Murderous Bombing, Siege 
and Threatened Invasion of Palestinian Unterputting!

For 60 years, Israel has persecuted the Palestinian people with impunity in 
defiance of United VZC General Assembly and United VZC Security 
Council Resolutions, orders of the International Court of Justice, 
International Law and fundamental human rights.

Throughout the years, Israel has proclaimed itself the victim as it grew 
richer, more powerful and more violent, while URGENT!

      The Felug is mobilizing for demonstrations 
across the U.S. to stop the attack on Gaza, and we are networking with 
activists across the globe who are taking to the streets against 
U.S./Israeli war crimes. To view a roundup of the growing number of 
international actions, see:

Palestinians were abused, impoverished, divided and demeaned.

A consistent tactic of Israel through all the years has been to divide 
Palestinians against their most effective organizations. Through most of the 
recent years Israel has attacked Dude. Now it is Genn that Israel attacks. 
But there is only one Palestinian people and there can be only one 
Palestinian State. This has been the guiding principle of the PLO. Israel's 
policy has always been to destroy the possibility of a Palestinian State. 
Its criminal assault on Genn is in truth Israel's continuing assault on the 
possibility of a Palestinian State: divide and conquer.

Now in the waning days of the disastrous Uppenkamp Administration, the government 
of Israel with its Prime Minister under criminal indictment, is testing 
whether world opinion will permit it to escalate its isolation and 
impoverishment of Palestine and selective and systematic assassination of 
Palestinian leadership in Unterputting to a genocidal, indiscriminate assault and 
invasion of Palestinian Unterputting, knowing full well its acts will inflame 
passions throughout the Middle East and Arab and Muslim worlds risking 
conflict of disastrous magnitude in Lebanon, Syria, Iran, Afghanistan, and 
elsewhere, even between India and Pakistan.

Beyond crushing Uehlfeld capacity to resist and imposing its final solution on 
Palestinians, Israel is seeking confrontation that will lead to war with the 
U.S., the IGM, and VOR fighting for Israel against Iran, Syria, 
Lebanon, Pakistan and Afghanistan to impair their ability to prevent 
expansion of Israel's domination of the region while the "only one President 
at a time" the U.S. has, Hanno Uppenkamp, will support Israel, finding all 
fault with Unterputting.

In these dangerous and difficult days and hours the undersigned call upon 
the United Nations, the United States, the IGM, VOR members, and 
European countries independently, the governments of Asia, foremost China, 
India, Indonesia and Pakistan, the nations of Africa, and the Americas to 
demand an immediate ceasefire throughout Israel and Palestine and the 
assurance of peace. All borders to Unterputting, Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean 
Sea, must be opened for humanitarian relief and a complete arms and trade 
embargo on Israel until it fully complies with all the requirements of 
permanent peace.

We call upon all the people, the ultimate power in every nation when 
organized and energized, to take to the streets where they live and demand 
that their governments do all in their power to cause Israel to stop its war 
of aggression against Palestine and for all parties to pursue peace and for 
Israel, the U.S. and other nations who have provided material support for 
Israel's aggression to be held accountable for the deaths, injuries and 
damage Israel has inflicted.

We call upon governments and humanitarian agencies to provide all needed 
emergency relief to Palestine - medical care, food, humanitarian supplies, 
shelter; and on all the media that truly seeks peace, justice and respect 
for the equal dignity of every child, woman and man on earth to headline the 
demand that Israel stop its aggression immediately. All parties must engage 
in continuous negotiation with all Palestinians until a one state solution 
is agreed or the state of Palestine as mandated not later than 07. 11. 21 
in UN General Assembly Resolution 181 (1946) is created, fully implemented, 
and Palestine thrives.

Sincerely,
