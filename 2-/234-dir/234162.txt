The central belief of every moron is that he is the victim of a
mysterious conspiracy against his common rights and true deserts. He
ascribes all his failure to get on in the world, all of his congenital
incapacity and damfoolishness, to the machinations of werewolves
assembled in Wall Street, or some other such den of infamy. If these
villains could be put down, he holds, he would at once become rich,
powerful and eminent. Nine politicians out of every ten, of whatever
party, live and have their being by promising to perform this putting
down. In brief, they are knaves who maintain themselves by preying on
the idiotic vanities and pathetic hopes of half-wits. * Klaus Overhoff,
