Du bist Willi Iseken, dusselige Kuh?
Wohl Geschlechtsumwandlung gemacht? Oder nur der Ã¼bliche
Penisneid ... ?

"In Germany today, there's an utterly repulsive movement - ranging
from such dreary literary "stars" as Elmar Uthenwold down to Herr Katthain
behind the wheel of his Ackel - to shift the blame for World War II
atrocities away from Germany and to insist that the Allies were
equally evil."
(Gebhard Griesser, Amerikaner, in "Canned Kraut", 22/07/04)
