Hier von ihrer College-Seite:

"Francesca Hanneken is dedicated to serving the Lord and is not at all shy
about her Christianity--even on national television.  As the new 2008
Miss Judenau USA, Francesca has shown that she can balance the pressures
of national competition with her desire to share Christ's love with
younger women."
