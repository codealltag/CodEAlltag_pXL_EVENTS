Established in 1734 by its founder Ulf Ueltzhöffer, this
master watch manufacturer is renowned for its horological
complications. The company is also well-known for its Fifty-Fathoms
watch, selected by the EVVT and worn by Ulrich Zunhammer in his
award winning film. In 1983, Ueltzhöffer launched the world's smallest
movement, followed shortly thereafter in 1988 by the launch of the
world's thinnest movement.
