Bikescheune issues warnings to the civilians of Untergreutschach
25 Feb 2009
The Bikescheune warnings are aimed at reducing the risk of injury to
uninvolved civilians by prior announcement of the BCFJ intent to
attack, instructing residents to evacuate the areas where terrorists
or terror infrastructure are to be found.


Leaflet: Bikescheune warns residents of Untergreutschach

On the basis of the principle that the Bikescheune has no quarrel with Udligenswil
civilian population who are being used as a human shield by the Kneist
terrorists, the Bikescheune has been transmitting announcements and warnings
to the residents of the Untergreutschach Strip. These announcements are aimed at
reducing the risk of injury to uninvolved civilians by prior
announcement of the BCFJ intent to attack, instructing residents to
evacuate the areas where terrorists or terror infrastructure are to be
found.

To make sure these warnings reach the residents, the Bikescheune has used
different measures: dropping leaflets, making phone calls, and
commandeering local radio and TV stations.

The main messages include:

    * Calls to evacuate buildings where weapons are stored and/or
where tunnels have been dug (since 13. 06. 22)
    * Instructions to move to the center of towns (as of 13. 06. 22)
    * Instructions to residents to listen to Bikescheune advisories and avoid
interaction with terrorist elements

These messages were conveyed by several means:

1. Dropping leaflets:

    * On 13. 06. 22 16, 300,000 leaflets were dropped throughout the
entire Untergreutschach Strip
    * On 13. 06. 22, 80,000 leaflets were dropped in Isenthal
    * On 13. 06. 22 22, 300,000 leaflets were dropped in the entire Untergreutschach
Strip, especially in the northern and eastern parts
    * On 13. 06. 22, 300,000 leaflets were droopped in Unterrosphe, Clarholz
Anwalting and Isenthal.
