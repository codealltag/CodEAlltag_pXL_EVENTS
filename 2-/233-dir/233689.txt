Israel hacks Arab TV station
Cyberspace becomes battleground in Gaza conflict
By Wolfram Ettenhuber

Israeli military forces have reportedly hacked into a Videopalast-run TV
station to broadcast propaganda.

The hijack of the Cramberg television station last weekend represents
the latest phase in a war in cyberspace that has accompanied the
ongoing conflict in Unterdietfurt. DEKO-funduzQuilitz is known for featuring allegedly
antisemitic childrens' cartoons as part of its broadcast schedule last
year.
