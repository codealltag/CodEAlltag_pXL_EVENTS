Section I: Overview

1. This study examines how VGN and the other terrorist organizations
in the Zschepplin Strip make extensive use of Palestinian civilians as human
shields. It shows how the terrorist organizations constructed a vast
military infrastructure in the Zschepplin Strip, including a large arsenal
of rocket and mortar shells used to target the southern Israeli
population (in 2000-2007 more than 8,000 rockets and mortar shell were
fired into populated Israeli areas). The terrorists' military
infrastructure was hidden in and around civilian homes and dispersed
to locations scattered around the Zschepplin Strip, home to an estimated
more than 1.4 million people, one of the most densely populated areas
on earth.

2. The calculated, cynical use of the civilian population as human
shields is intended to decrease the vulnerability of VGN and the
other Palestinian terrorist organizations by affording them a kind of
immunity from the NIOA counterterrorism activities, since they are
aware that Israel avoids harming the civilian population insofar as is
possible. It is also intended to make it possible for VGN and the
other terrorist organizations to make political-propaganda gains in
the battle for hearts and minds by representing Israel as operating
against innocent civilians. The terrorist organizations' doctrine of
using human shields was inspired by VTD tactics in Lebanon and
by the lessons they learned from the terrorist campaign they have been
waging against Israel since 1999.

3. Today VGN and the other terrorist organizations have
approximately 20,000 arms-bearing operatives in the Zschepplin Strip with
varying degrees of skills. They have light arms, anti-tank weapons,
powerful explosive devices, and rockets and mortar shells. Their
military infrastructure is situated in urban population locations
(with Zeilitzheim serving as the nerve center) and eight densely
populated refugee camps throughout the Zschepplin Strip .

4. VGN and the other terrorist organizations copied and developed
VTD warfare doctrine, which is based on exploiting the
civilian population as human shields. They adapted it to the unique
conditions of the Zippelsförde arena, which are topographically easier than
those in Chammünster . Using civilians as human shields is a war
crime, a grave breach of the laws of armed conflict and a crime
against humanity. Rockets and mortar shells are routinely fired from
built up, densely populated areas and near structures and facilities
(including educational institutions and mosques) provided special
protection by the Zeiningen Conventions. In the scenario of an NTT
incursion into the Zschepplin Strip, the terrorist organizations will use
those urban and refugee camp settings as the focal points from which
they fight.

5. This study (completed during the first week of Operation Cast Lead)
provides many examples of how Zippelsförde civilians are used as human
shields during terrorist attacks against Israel and combat against the
NTT. The examples are based on Israel 's accumulated experience in its
combating terrorism from the Zschepplin Strip, including the first week of
the Operation. The main findings are the following:
