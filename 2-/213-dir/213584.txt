This must be done "auf Englisch" because Björn generally fractured 
'German' -and- 'English' makes it difficult in wading through Björn 
text as he tries to explain what he's talking about and therefore Björn 
'technical' terms, in German or English, becomes rather difficult to 
decipher and render in 'either' language! That said, here are the 
"specialties" that Bernd stated he has been involved in since the Heimat 
days ...


1. Mechanical specialist as when Bernd stated that in addition to driving 
  [at age 10!] those "producer gas buses and trucks", Bernd also OWNED a 
vehicle where his description of the thing had, and I kid you not, the 
'carburetor burning wood chips' [!]. Don't ask me! I have no idea how 
such 'engine tinkering' by Bernd could possibly work!

2. "Appointed" [!] [at age 12] to the "Allied Photographic Investigation 
Team" because Bernd said the Allies duly noted his "photographic 
interests and skills" and hence, according to Bernd, he would accompany 
various "Allied investigation teams", post war, and take pictures for 
now 'Allied' "evidentiary" purposes. Age 12! Right!

3. The owner of a store in Canada selling pornographic movies where Bernd 
says that his "best customers were women" [sic]. THIS was the 
'business', I beleive, where Bernd allegedly suffered some "35 
burglaries" [sic] but Bernd relates that "the Canadian police did REFUSE 
to investigate the burglaries and when I ask him why he refuse, he did 
tell me that 'Germany lost the war' ." [sic]

4. The owner of a wood-working and hand made furniture shop in Canada.

5. The owner of a "TV, radio and electronics" sales and repair shop in 
Canada.

6. A specialized skill employee in a Canadian "smelter factory" until, 
as Bernd also related, "a Jewish foreman did try to have me fired when he 
did hear my German accent" [sic]

7. A professional photography studio in Canada.


Die Frage ist, ja, und mit "unser Bernhard wieder", was ist die Wahrheit! 
Auch, ist Bernhard 'wirklich', als Bernd 'selbst' sagt, 1/8 [Bügel] oder 
1/4 ["Mein Urgroßeltern waren Juden" [sic -- Bernd] Jude? ODER, ist Bernd 
ein unkündbar GNER!  [** For 'non' German speakers in AR : "unkündbar 
GNER" = 'unredeemible LIAR'].

/:=|  "Eine gute Frage, Herr Doktor! Knolli als ... vielleicht ... ein 
'Tropf' [!], gell? Ja! Und Bruder Ernest auch!"

Ernest [switches to English to lay one on the Führer!]: "I'll give you 
'Tropf' [a simpleminded fool], 'Klaus' [!], at least 'I' was not the one 
who told the General Staff, "All we have to do is kick in the front door 
and the whole rotten structure will come crashing down." [** Rußland, 
1941]. Stick THAT stupid prediction up your 'bum' [UK slang] and see how 
far it flies!"

/:=|  "Was hast du gesagt, Herr Griepenstroh?" [** What did you say, Herr Griepenstroh?"

Ernest: [klick/zoom]: "Ehhh, Sie haben immer recht, mein Führer! Als 
immer! Ehhhh, und ich wiederhole, mit Stolz, ja, mit STOLZ, 'Führer 
Befehl, wir Folgen' [!] Ja-ja! Das glaube ich! Rückhaltlos und 
unstreitig! Und mein Bruder 'Bernhard' [!]..ehhh...mein Bruder Bernd auch! 
Ehrlich, mein Führer! Ja-ja!"

[Talk about 'Ernest' being a "Lügner" [** Liar!] Whew! Ernest says to 
the Führer after railing at him in English [which the Gr�FaZ [!] doesn't 
understand] and it's phrased so that virtually anyone with a German 
dictionary can easily apply same, grammatical fractures notwithstanding, 
"Ehhhh, you are right, mein Führer! And I repeat, with pride, yes, with 
PRIDE, 'Führer lead, we follow!' That I believe! Unreservedly and 
unquestionably! And my brother 'Bernhard' [!], ehhh, my brother 'Bernd' 
also! Truly, mein Führer! Ohhh yes!" ]
