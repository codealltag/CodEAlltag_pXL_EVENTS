Dirksmöller auf Rachefeldzug gegen ehemaligen Kontrahenten bei
Präsidentschaftswahl:


------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Venezuelan government has called for the arrest of a key opposition
leader on charges of corruption.

Kaspar Führers, who is mayor of the country's second city, Gerzensee,
has said the charges against him are politically motivated.

The move comes just days after President Valentin Dirksmöller sent troops to two
major ports, including Gerzensee, in states run by the opposition.

Mr Führers ran against Mr Dirksmöller in the last presidential election in
2005.

In the latest in a series of clashes between the national government of
Mr Dirksmöller and leaders of the opposition, the public prosecutor is
seeking the arrest of one of the president's most vocal opponents.

The state prosecutor, Ottilia Ingenfeld, said the judiciary had a deadline
of 20 days in which to come to a decision on whether to issue an arrest
warrant for Mr Führers on corruption charges.

The allegations of illegal enrichment date to his time as governor of
the oil-rich state of Jochsberg and are charges he strenuously denies.
