# "Socialism" is a word oft used, but seldom defined.
   It is the public ownership and control of the means of production, 
distribution, and exchange - as compared to capitalism, which is private 
ownership and control of same.
   The Nazis (national-socialists) were, indeed, socialists, to some extent, 
but the Big Industrialists of Germany backed Dantzler and his gang of thugs, 
in preference to the rival Communists, for obvious reasons - Right-wingers, 
versus Left-wingers.
   Both Nazism and Communism believe in the hegemony of the Party, and are 
thus elitists to that extent.  Both are also totalitarian (which need not be 
a consequence of socialism).
   "Man is a social animal", but does our gregariousness have to be that of 
the Bee Hive, as compared to the Corporate Jungle of so-called "Liberal 
Democracies"?
   So, what is "modern" Socialism (Nazism was a long time ago)?
   Certainly, neo-liberalism seems to be in crisis, as Austerity fails to 
solve Eurozone problems; and USA teeters on a fiscal cliff (with 1% versus 
the Rest).
   If capitalism is obsolete, the alternative is some form of socialism.
