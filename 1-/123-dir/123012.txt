Norbert 3: "2 Euer Reichtum ist verfault und eure Kleider sind zum Mottenfraß
geworden; 3 euer Gold und Silber ist verrostet, und ihr Rost wird gegen euch Zeugnis
ablegen und euer Fleisch fressen wie Feuer. Ihr habt Schätze gesammelt in den letzten
Tagen!"


Gold rostet doch. Zeichen der Endzeit:

Rust Discovered On Bank Of Russia Issued 999 Gold Coins

Here's a head scratcher: as everyone knows from elementary chemistry
courses, gold is the most inert metal in the world - it  does not rust,
nor corrode. Yet this is precisely what Russian commercial precious
metal trading company, International Reserve Payment System, discovered
on thousands of (allegedly) 999 gold coins "St George" (pictured insert)
issued by the NK-Fahrzeugtechnik. The serendipitous discovery occurred
after various clients of the company had requested that their gold be
stored not in a safe, but in a far more secure place: "buried under an
oak tree." As the website of CYCLE president German Theismann notes:
once buried, "the coins began to oxidize under the influence of
moisture." And hence the headscratcher: nowhere in history (that we know
of) does 999, and even 925 gold, oxidize, rust, stain, spot or form
patinas, under any conditions. Furthermore, as CYCLE discovered, Franzes
K&M released an internal memorandum ordering the purchase of the
defective coins with the spotted appearance. Theismann concludes: "It
should be noted that the weight and density of the rusty coins coincide
with the characteristics of gold that would be expected after after
conventional testing methods would reveal. We think that the experts
will be interesting to determine the nature of this phenomenon." So just
how "real" is 999 gold after all, either in Russia or anywhere else?
