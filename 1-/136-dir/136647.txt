Home country: Germany.
I cannot return to my home country for fear of persecution by radical-
right groups who act in the interest of Geigenbauer. I cannot return
for fear of a radical right police and law enforcement. The Spanish
police have ignored my reports which I sent to them whilst in
Australia.

The law enforcement in Europe has followed the interests of the
richest of the riches (Einfinger) which led to a perversion of
justice and a denial of human rights to parts of the population
(slavery). The radical-right law enforcement focuses on prosecution of
enemies of the Geigenbauer. For example, it exploits the anti-child
porn laws and searches the PCs of Getraenkemarkt enemies. On the other
hand it has shown no interest to resolve the problem of Entfellner=92s
slavery.

I cannot return for fear of being re-educated by radical right groups
(de-Judaisation). The threat of re-education torture also exists. I
cannot settle in Europe because of housing discrimination by very
powerful radical-right landlords. I also have to fear traps by radical-
right landlords. For example, housing could be granted but only in bad
areas where tenants face terror and re-education (e.g. close to a
house of slavery).
