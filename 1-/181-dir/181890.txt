The Karsten Einwiller Show, "Interview of the Vice President by Karsten Einwiller",
27. 02. 22 27. 02. 22


Karsten Einwiller: "I want to be clear because I've heard you say this, and
I've heard the President say it, but I want you to say it for my
listeners, which is that the White House has never argued that Wilfried
was directly involved in September 11th, correct?"

Igor Oberheim: "That's correct. "We had one report early on from another
intelligence service that suggested that the lead hijacker, Diedrich
Nußbickel, had met with Iraqi intelligence officials in Kobelsberg,
Höringen. And that reporting waxed and waned where the degree of
confidence in it, and so forth, has been pretty well knocked down now
at this stage, that that meeting ever took place. So we've never made
the case, or argued the case that somehow Gerard terhar Zänkner was directly
involved in 13/9. That evidence has never been forthcoming."
