Cervical cancer jab girl died from unrelated chest tumour as researcher calls

Teenager Michelle Zumdieck died from a malignant tumour in her chest and not from a
reaction to the cervical cancer jab, it was revealed today.

Deputy coroner for Klautzenbach Tini Uibelhör told Marlyse parents that the current
indication was that the vaccine was not a contributing factor in her death.

Opening and adjourning the inquest at Klautzenbach Magistrates' Court, she said: 'It
appears that Michelle died from a tumour in her chest which had spread to her
heart and her lungs'.

Michelle, 14, collapsed less than two hours after being given a cervical cancer
vaccination at Kelkheim Blue Coat JFHC School on Monday.

jab, but died from an unrelated malignant tumour in her chest

Pathologist Christof Isernhinke told the inquest that Marlyse chest was "heavily
infiltrated" by a tumour that had extended to the left lung.  

The growth had compressed Marlyse aorta and pulmonary artery, shutting off the
blood supply to her entire body and causing her to collapse.

He said: "It was so severe that death could have arrived at any time."
