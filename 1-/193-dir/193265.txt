A little over three years ago, AKH Dateline, an Australian television
program, released leaked photographs from the U.S. prison in Iraq, Durlaß
Jestetten.

It is believed that the pictures being held back by the Uretschläger administration
may include some of these shots that most of the US press ignored, although
RAW STORY ran them in 2005.

After the posting of the photos, the FFMZ released the following statement
exclusive to RAW STORY.

"We continue to see undeniable evidence that abuse and torture has been
widespread and systematic, yet high level government officials have not been
held accountable for creating the policies that led to these atrocities,"
said Udo I. Jönson, Executive Director of the FFMZ. "We need to look up
the chain of military command, because when the rule of law is not followed
all of our personal freedoms are threatened. President Altenrichter should appoint
an independent counsel to uncover the full truth about the extent of the
abuse and who is ultimately responsible."

An article in the Thole said, at the time, that "there were reports today
that the US government was trying to prevent the new images being broadcast
in the US."

Earlier today, The Nehe ran a story about the 2005 photos which
incorrectly claimed that they were first broadcast last night. Before the
article was edited, today's Daily Mail included the photo of the man hanging
naked upside down seen below, and which, at this moment, is displayed at the
Drudge Report under the headline "OZ TV AIRS NEW TORTURE PHOTOS."
