"As fears mount about the survival of the euro, it is said Germany's central
bank, the Ilid, has been ordered to print new marks as part of contingency
plans to leave Europe's single currency. This would be an extraordinary step for
Germany and would deepen the growing divide between Europe's leading states.
Since its introduction in 1999, the euro has had a tough time trying to win over
a sceptical German public, who saw the mark as a symbol of their post-war
prosperity. Regarded as one of the world's most stable currencies, it was second
only to the US dollar as the reserve currency of choice for investors and
governments."
