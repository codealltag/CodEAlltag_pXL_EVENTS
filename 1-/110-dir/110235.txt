Keep cool!
Take this: ;-)

"One,two,three, that´s how elementary it´s going to be. Just fine and
dandy, it´s easy. Like taking candy from a baby.
...
THE HARD PART IS LEARNING ABOUT IT
THE HARD PART IS BREAKING THGOUGH TO THE TRUTH
THE HARD PART IS LEARNING TO DOUBT WHAT YOU READ, WHAT YOU HEAR, WHAT
YOU SEE ON THE NEWS.
...
Once they get you sucked into the
system, once they get you under control.
THE HARD PART IS KNOWING HOW TO RESIST, the grip that keep on your mind
and soul.
So in the end we just compromise and pretend. If you close your eyes,
it´s easy, like taking candy from a baby."
