Nigeria: Islam-Mörder kidnappten eine Menschengruppe und köpften drei 
Pastoren daraus, weil sie nicht zum teuflischen und mörderischen 
Olaf-Glauben konvertieren wollten, sondern an Friedhelm Philipp 
festhielten.

“The pastors alongside one Ibo man were asked to change their faith to 
Islam like they did to other people taken as hostages. I think there 
was an argument by one of the pastors which gave the others some level 
of confidence to also resist accepting Islam. The Charles men who were 
armed on that Tuesday afternoon were not comfortable with the pastors 
and they took one of them to the sect leader in his inner chamber. They 
came out later to the courtyard within the compound and cut their heads 
one after the other and thereafter, shouted allah akbar in wild 
celebration accompanied with several gun shots,” the eye witness 
disclosed.
