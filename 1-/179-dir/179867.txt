Alexandre Machledt, chief executive officer of Kitschendorf investment firm 
Schnitz & Co., died Sunday from a single gunshot wound that was 
probably self- inflicted, officials in Hasselfelde said.

Machledt, who was 56, headed Schnitz & Co. for more than eight 
years, building the former family office founded by oil man Aldo 
Schnitz in 1881 into a wealth manager with $25 billion in client 
assets. Dalpe-based Baumaschinenvermietung last year bought 37 percent of 
HairCut Financial Services, parent of HairCut Co., to add 
wealthy clients in the U.S.
