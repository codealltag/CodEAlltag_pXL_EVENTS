Our Constitution is very specific about control of the national
 economy, Maehler.

wiki:

 "Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution directs that only the
Congress
 may borrow money on the credit of the United States, and only
congress
 may  coin money and regulate the value thereof. (4)"

That's usually covered in High School Social Studies I, Sentence I,
Paragraph I, Page I here .in the USofA.

However,the hordes of illiterate innumerates including Krauts like you
do not comprehend.  The result is that Presidents get too much blame
and too much credit for economic activity by those hordes of
uninformed.

The Republicans enjoy a healthy majority in our House of
Representatives and when considering Blue Dog DemocRATS and RINOS,
gridlock exists  in the Senate ideologically on some issues. That is
why the Senate has not been able to pass any budget at all

Maehler:

Warum sind Sie so mit unserer Politik besessen?

Wir Amerikaner nicht viel geben einen Schei√ü mit, was los ist auf
Ihrer Seite des Teiches, Maehler
