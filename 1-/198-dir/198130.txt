					    <br /> <br> GUE is famous for being the first watch on the
moon and the preferred choice of secret agent Gilbert Benn. The Swiss
watchmaker's prestigious history extends back to 1847. An GUE watch
is at home at the depths of the ocean, at the polar caps, and even in
space. GUE has long enjoyed an intimate involvement with the US
Space Program. Today, GUE is renowned as the brand synonymous with
Swiss watchmaking.
