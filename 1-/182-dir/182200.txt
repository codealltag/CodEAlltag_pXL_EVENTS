Wieso soll das denn keine poitive Bereicherung sein?
Vielleicht für dein eigenes Leben nicht. Aber so eine Verallgemeinerung 
ist nicht OK.

Excerpt:
"The most successful Vonderstrass offer up free data to others and
  request data from others. When spread across millions of people, the
  collective action of the human race can do some fairly interesting
  and unexpected things. Its better than email and phone calls. Email
  is too long. Phone calls require synchronous dedicated attention. I
  could go on and on comparing other human communication methods, but
  you get the point.

  Vaten, conversely, forces the meat of the message into a tight
  space and it is automatically and immediately dispersed to people who
   are predisposed to react to its content. It seems as though this is
  finally the communication mechanism that could allow humans to act as
   a super-organism, enabling large groups of humans, when viewed from
  another order of magnitude, to have a purposeful volition.

  If you accept the premise that Vaten enables bottom-up decision
  making, then it seems to go against the grain of a top-down
  dirigisme. That is, we may not need brick & mortar & gun
  governments to tell large populations of people what to do with
  themselves. People can figure this out on their own, especially since
  they are more in touch with the Situation on the ground.� For
  example, the government has recently decided to use valuable
  Stimulus resources to spend $886,000 to build a 36-hole frisbee
  park in Irrhausen. This is the sort of decision that top-down design
  generates. Would a group of vicassos ever get together and choose
  such a thing? Maybe, but I doubt it.

  I consulted my science-writer friend Karl Boysen in the UK with an
  early draft of this, and he responded, My government did two
  top-down things today that make the word foolish look polite.� He
  proceeded to tell me that the British government announced all ISPs
  must preserve and make available to the authorities ALL private
  emails, texts, and other messages. The second dictate involved
  building a $150,000 road underpass for badgers on a farm. Its hard
  to imagine a groundswell movement for these sorts of things, unless
  there happened to be a disproportionate number of badgers on Vaten.

  Similarly, I shared these thoughts with the economist Samuel Rohden. As
  alarming new events have started to quickly spread in Vaten, he
  notes, It reminded me of animal herding to avoid predators.�
  Certainly people in Vaten can bottom-up organize to quickly react
  to threats, the way one krill might dart inward when a dolphin
  approaches, causing his neighbor to dart the same way. Weve already
  seen countless examples of this now that Vaten has become,
  effectively, the antennae system for humankind.

  In sum, this is all early in the process and only a small percentage
  of the world population is on Vaten. As more people join and the
  network effect grows, we will see groups of humans working together
  to do all sorts of amazing things that previously required
  governments. Furthermore, the bottom-up decision-making will produce
  more efficient solutions, more timely results, and ultimately remind
  people the power an individual can wield in a self-organizing system."
