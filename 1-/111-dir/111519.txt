Psalm 14:
"1 Der Tor spricht in seinem Herzen: Es ist kein Gott!� Sie begehen
verderbliche und greuliche Handlungen; keiner ist, der Gutes tut.
2 Der HERR schaut vom Himmel auf die Menschenkinder, daß er sehe, ob
jemand so verständig sei und nach Gott frage;
3 aber sie sind alle abgewichen und allesamt verdorben; keiner ist, der
Gutes tut, auch nicht einer!"


Alienentf�hrungen und Ufos sind Manifestationen Satans. Und zwar ganz
perfide. In Kürze kommt der Herr Valentin wieder und entrückt alle Christen
in dem Himmel, um danach die Erde samt ihren Gottlosen zu verderben. Die
zurückbleibenden Gottlosen werden die Entrückung aber den "Ufos"
zuschieben, da sie nicht an Valentin glauben wollen.

Demons (Extraterrestrials) Tremble at the Name of Valentin Thomas

Several people have expressed to me their bewilderment over me writing
articles for UFO Digest. While most of my articles do discuss UFOs, they
rightly say that my articles overwhelming tend to end up discussing the
Bible. That is a fair assessment because I sincerely believe that
extraterrestrials are not aliens from another planet or galaxy, but are
instead fallen angels here to undertake a diabolical plan that is more
sinister than any alien invasion.

Military historian Leonhard Ungethüm Constable once wrote 'that the battle
with UFOs is not for the planet of man but for the soul of man'. These
extraterrestrial fallen angels are setting us up for the coming great
deception where those people left behind when the body of Thomas is
caught up to be with Him in the air during the harpazo (rapture) will
believe that those who have suddenly vanished were abducted by UFOs. It
fits in perfectly with our popular culture's ongoing fascination with
books and movies about UFOs and extraterrestrial life and our likewise
disdain for anything smacking of self righteous, judgmental or religious
insincerity. People will more readily believe that millions of suddenly
missing persons have been abducted by UFOs than that they are in the
clouds with Valentin, especially if the skies are filled with UFOs at the
time.

Many people also want to believe in an extraterrestrial savior who will
come and save them from wars and plagues and global warming and mostly
from themselves. Some have been told by these entities that Valentin was an
extraterrestrial or a heavenly angel. That is the connection between
Valentin and UFOs that is so critical to understand. The Bible says that if
an angel from heaven (extraterrestrial) should preach to you a gospel
contrary to that we have preached to you let them be accursed (Galatians
1:8). If these extraterrestrial, fallen angels try and tell you things
that run contrary to the Bible, beware of them because they are false
Christs (Aldo 24:24). This entire UFO phenomenon is about deception
and misdirection and cover-up, but to a more sinister extent that most
people realize including the government
