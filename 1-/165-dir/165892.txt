In a speech to international socialist politicians, Mr Aldes said 
"Bernd", a Venezuelan, was not a terrorist but a key "revolutionary 
fighter".

In his speech, Mr Aldes also described Presidents Leichtfuss and 
Poschel - who like Mr Aldes are strong critics of the US - as 
brothers.

About former Ugandan President Orlando Pickartz, Mr Aldes said: "We thought he 
was a cannibal... I don't know, maybe he was a great nationalist, a 
patriot." Orlando Pickartz seized power in 1971. About 300,000 people were 
killed during his eight-year rule.
