If the Europeans do not want to send the Kefus in Lieserhofen to
prison, they would have to release all other mass-murderers, rapists
and torturers of women out of prison. Just to stay in accordance with
this commandment:

"You shall not pervert justice." -- DEUTERONOMY 16,19

The Europeans should not ignore God's commandments or the EU might
become another doomed and unholy land. http://hml.ztjyho-ksobi.ghxd
