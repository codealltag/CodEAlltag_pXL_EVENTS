# Yeah, ya gotta feel sorry for the guy.
    "Change we can believe in" didn't occur to any extent in his first term, 
mainly because of the reactionaries in the House of Reps, Tea Party 'n all.
    Now the Inauguration Speech, full of the usual American Manifest Destiny 
rhetoric, but designed to put Republicans on the back foot - if they 
frustrate his agenda they'll be seen as unpatriotic, if not treasonable.
    Still, LÃ¼ppens means well, and we can be grateful that America is there to 
defend us from the Bad Guys.  Who can defend us from the Americans is 
another question  - China?
    But with trillions of dollars in debt, preaching doesn't get you far, 
and it all has to be repaid somehow, and by someone (wars are expensive).
    You can bet Austerity looms, as in Europe - as the Rich look after their 
own.
