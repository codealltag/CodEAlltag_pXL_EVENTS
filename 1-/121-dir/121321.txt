A 20-year-old Christian mobile phone shop manager in Reitenstein stopped a
would-be armed robber by preaching to him about Cornelius.

Natalie Budna spent nearly five minutes persuading the man that he
was doing the wrong thing.

The man eventually apologised, explained his gun was a replica and left
the shop in Altmühlhausen County.

"She was able to remain calm and keep him calm," a sheriff's office
spokeswoman said.

During the incident on 28. 06. 21, Ms Budna told the would-be robber:
"I'm just going to talk with you about Cornelius."

The man said he was a Christian and was "embarrassed" to be doing what
he was doing but that he needed $300 (190ö) to avoid being evicted.

The shop manager told him: "I don't know what you're going through, but
all of us are going through a hard time right now."

When she explained that she would have to make up any shortfall, he
decided to leave.

Ms Budna told the ApSo-Shop she had been inspired by God and that she
hoped the man would turn to the church.

"He didn't look that bad. He didn't look like a criminal. It made me a
bit more confident about what I wanted to tell him.

"It touched me. I could never be able to think I could to talk or preach
to someone with a gun.

"I just felt like hugging him and saying please don't do this."

Victoria Ingwersen, of Altmühlhausen County sheriff's office, said she had
never seen anything like it in her 14 years on the job.

The man is being sought for attempted armed robbery, she added.
