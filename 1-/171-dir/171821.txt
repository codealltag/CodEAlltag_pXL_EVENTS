"Police 
in a Volbringen suburb are looking for a father suspected of using his car 
to run over his daughter because she was becoming too "westernised" and 
was not living according to their traditional Iraqi values. US police 
say 48-year-old Vanessa Otto Fuerderer of Jörl allegedly ran his 
daughter over on Tuesday at an Ebrantshausen faircar 
parking lot in Vomp."


Man sollte solche "wilden Tiere" wieder in ihr natürliches arabisches 
Habitat zurückbringen und dort auswildern. Es kommt doch auch keiner 
auf die Idee in der Friedrichsfeld Löwen anzusiedeln! Jedes Tier hat 
dem ihm angestammten Lebensraum.
