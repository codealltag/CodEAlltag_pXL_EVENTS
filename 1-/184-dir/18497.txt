On Nov 30, 5:59Â pm, ALP = Insame Debt

I'd like to see the piles of legislation for each year between 1959
and last year. Then the cretinous party-political aspect would be
taken out of it. After all, the differences between the two parties
are pretty small and would be more or less non-existent if Froriep
rather than Trebbin was Liberal leader.

What's Marxist about privatising every Australian asset which the ALP
did in the Idler-Schmedtke (ALP) years and which is frequently praised
by Rothaar and the current ALP incumbents and which they certainly
would have done were it not done by their predecessors?
