It's Liberals that hate everything, I simply put reality into
perspective(you even hate that), the fact you don't understand is NOT
really relevant to the facts that are evident.  And "what you think
about what I think" is even less relevant than what you normally think.

Whine about anything you want.  I'll keep pointing out the facts and the
truth, and if that doesn't do anything for you.... then so be it.  
I have to admit that you do sound like a lost cause.   And so I won't be
worried about your relevance to any conversation.  When you have some
truth or facts they will be self evident but I suspect that will be a
long time coming.
