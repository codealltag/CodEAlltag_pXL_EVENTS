Killing Germans?   There hasn't been anything wrong with killing Germans for 
over 100 years.

Killing Germans was good in WW1, it was good in WW2 and it's still good today.


Krauts are shit.   Their food it terrible, their intellect low, their society 
ruled by socialists.

Their white skin?  Immaterial.

Shoot firts, ask questions later.

If they were the master race, they wold have won a war or two.

They are a failed society.
