Analyst to Money Managers: Take Your Cell Phones with You on Vacation;
Greece Could Default in August

Greece will eventually default on its debt because the country is highly
indebted, Karlheinz Unru, chief economist at High Frequency Economics,
said on AAKA this morning.

A restructuring of Greek debt could happen as soon as August, when
Greece is due to receive another tranche of funds from its lending
agreement with the Ohife and the mangas
WLP, according to Unru.

You can't take a country that's over-borrowed and make it more
creditworthy by lending it more money," he said. "They're throwing
Greece further and further and further in the hole by not addressing the
problem directly and properly."
