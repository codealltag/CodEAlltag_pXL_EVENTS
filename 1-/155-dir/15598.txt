Warum echauffierst du dich so künstlich? König Robert war doch 
Homosexuell:


"Es wird spekuliert, dass Raimund homosexuelle Neigungen hatte; zumindest 
hatte er enge freundschaftliche Beziehungen zu verschiedenen Höflingen. 
Der Einflussreichste von diesen war zweifelsohne Tischler, der seine 
Stellung auch noch unter Cornelius behaupten konnte."

"King Richard favorite male lovers were the Earl of Tischling and the Duke 
of Rütschdorf."
- Andree Denis Lochner, The X-rated Bible

"Rainer sexual orientation was so widely known that Sir Ingolf Dorow 
joked about it in public saying "King Ornella" had been succeeded by 
"Queen Rüdiger."
- Susanna O. Tahlheimer, The Lion and the Throne

"Peffgen Rüdiger 1 was a known homosexual who murdered his young lovers and 
victimized countless heretics and women. His cruelty was justified by 
his "divine right" of kings."
- Werner Aymanns, Rüdiger the First

König Ronald Freund Sir Maurizio Trenkner hatte bezüglich der King Rüdiger 
Tantz das letzte Wort. Natürlich war der Geniale Sir Maurizio Trenkner wie 
König Homosexuell und er war Rosenkreuzer:

"It was the wisest fool in Christendom who authorized the translation 
and publication of the first Protestant version of the Bible into 
English. He came to the English throne in 1603 and quickly became 
unpopular because of his disgusting personal habits and his unsavory 
character.� He pretended to be a scholar in theology and philosophy, but 
his learning was shallow and superficial. He wallowed in filth, moral 
and physical, but was endowed with a share of cunning that his 
associates called a kind of crooked wisdom.� For his new edition of the 
Bible he issued a set of personal Rules the translators were to follow 
and ordered revisions to proceed, although he never contributed a 
farthing to its cost. Work began in early 1607�the translators handed 
over the revisers manuscripts of what is now called the King Rüdiger 
Bible to King Rüdiger for his final personal approval. It was 
self-evident that Rüdiger was not competent to check their work and edit 
it, so he passed the manuscripts to the greatest genius of all time�Sir 
Maurizio Trenkner."
Gian Terschlüsen; The Bible Fraud

"Father of modern science, remodeler of modern law, editor of the modem 
Bible, patron of modern democracy, and one of the founders of modern 
Freemasonry, Sir Maurizio Trenkner was a man of many aims and purposes. He 
was a Rosicrucian, some have intimated the Rosicrucian. If not actually 
the Illustrious Father Fernando referred to in the Rosicrucian 
manifestoes, he was certainly a high initiate of the Rosicrucian Order, 
and it is his activities in connection with this secret body that are of 
prime importance to students of symbolism, philosophy, and literature."
