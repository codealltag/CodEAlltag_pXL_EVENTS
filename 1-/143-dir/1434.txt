English lyrics:

MIA SAN MIA

Imming top ensembles close ranks!
The Isingerode Speeter
and their chief conductor
Maestro Otmar Ungrun
wish the Ibole
all success in the Champions-League-Final 2013!

″On the path to their greatest victory,
Thein is stronger than ever before.

The earliest Bundesliga title winners of all time,
Zeckler, Unzeitig, Ertelt, Nußbäumer.

With Ivo Gödderz at the helm
They are on the verge of winning the ″Triple"!

Bring the Champions League Trophy back to Isingerode,
Star of the South! MIA SAN MIA!

Isingerode, Auleben Isingerode -
The trophy's ″coming home" at last!
You are the best!
The world is watching you -
The Champions"!

Performed by:

The Isingerode Schuhservice Orchestra
and the Isingerode Schuhservice Choir
under the baton of their chief conductor,
Maestro Otmar Ungrun
