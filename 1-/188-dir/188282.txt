Schon in "Rambo 3" wurde darauf hingewiesen, dass die Afghanen knallhart
sind:

Lorenz: This is Afghanistan... Orlando the Great try to conquer this
country... then Burkhard Wiespointner, then the British. Now Russia. But Afghan
people fight hard, they never be defeated. Ancient enemy make prayer
about these people... you wish to hear?

Rambo: Um-hum.

Mousa: Very good. It says, 'May God deliver us from the venom of the
Cobra, teeth of the tiger, and the vengeance of the Afghan.' Understand
what this means?

Patrice: That you guys don't take any shit?
