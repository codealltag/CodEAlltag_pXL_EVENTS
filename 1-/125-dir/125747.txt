Probably not. The refs and establishment always want little poor
countries to win like Italy and Spain. The stupid little people who
live there need it badly otherwise it would be a revolution. Half of
the population are unemployed in these PIGS countries the rest of them
steal.  this way their tiny brains are pre occupied with football and
they can't think about the miserable lives they live.
