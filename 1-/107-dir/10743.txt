obarmy said he would ban lobbyists...

a recent estimate is that every $ invested in lobbying
    obarmy's chicago mob returns $220

far better than working in productive pursuits..as
    long as the $billion per annum plus in borrowings
    is not turned off...
eventually obarmy will have no more borrowing
    with which to buy votes


australia is a huge country with huge resources and a relatively
    small population...

such a country can live for a long time with stupidity and waste
