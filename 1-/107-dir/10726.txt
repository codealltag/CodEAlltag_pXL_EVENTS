there are always plentiful fools....some of them
     will eventually vote republican...
but socialism is a creed designed for fools...

most of politics is herds running hither and thither


as with the socialists in europe...at some point
    the debts will get out of hand...

the trouble for socialists is that they eventually
    run out of other people's money
