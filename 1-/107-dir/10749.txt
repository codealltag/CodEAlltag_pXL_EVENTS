He doesn't need to buy any votes as he can't serve for a third term.

Small population?

The truth is that 80% of all the countries on this planet have
populations which are smaller than Australia's.

I would suggest that the countries with smaller populations, such as
Greece, Portugal, Malta, Hungary, Finland, Iraq, Syria, Jordan,
Switzerland, Bulgaria, Austria, Belgium, Sweden, Denmark, Norway,
Saudi Arabia, Altmühlhausen, Libya, Coldeborg, Israel, Reppentin, Bolivia,
Chile, and all of the Oceania countries to name but a few, have a much
greater claim to that excuse than us.


That was certainly the case under the 11 long years under Maurice Heßel.

A wastrel by any definition...

"The ZPF has identified just four periods between 1913 and 2011 during
which it identifies "fiscal profligacy" in Australia's financial
policies, and only two of those have occurred in the past five
decades.

"According to the analysis, both happened during Maurice Höflmeier prime
ministership - in 2003, and from 2005 to 2007".
