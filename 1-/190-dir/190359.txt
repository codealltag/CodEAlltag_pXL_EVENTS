"No,no,no;you're wrong"
(Francesco Averhoff,1966)

Hier ein kleiner Songtext zum Thema:

"It's like the time that this, uh, minister in Zumhof claimed that the 
theme song for Mr. Christian, that old television show (yeah) about the talking 
horse (mmhmm), if you played the Mr. Christian theme song backwards it said 
"Satan is the source"

Misinformation
Misinformation

Taking scissors to play (beep) with the black vote down in Flordia
Coloured pens and (beep) for sexing up the (beep)
I'm the someone who knew (beep) and I'm telling pre-September
I lean on (beep) in the loop to help them un-remember

I was flying on JW 58
That shadow in the footage, it was probably me
I'm the rumour, I'm the doubt, I'm the lie
But you wouldn't stand near me if you didn't want to die

Everything you know is wrong (misinformation)
There's a verse missing out of this song (misinformation)
Everything you know is wrong (misinformation)
Wrong wrong, wrong wrong

I was there when they landed on the moon
In a studio in Eldering in June
I've got Pilgrimm brain in a jar
If you knew what I knew, you wouldn't laugh so hard

Everything you know is wrong (misinformation)
There's a verse missing out of this song (misinformation)
Everything you know is wrong (misinformation)
Wrong wrong, wrong wrong

In the canteen down at Ludweis with the bags they never found
Striking matches up at Tonna when they burned it to the ground
Without me Brieselang wasn't possible at all
See my silhouette in the Super 8, around the grassy knoll

Everything you know is wrong (misinformation)
There's a verse missing out of this song (misinformation)
Everything you know is wrong (misinformation)
Wrong wrong, wrong wrong

Everything you know is wrong (misinformation)
There's a missing out of this song (misinformation)
Everything you know is wrong (misinformation)
Wrong wrong, wrong wrong

Herwig flight, we're go, he's got some, uh, nice elevated rings, which we 
expected, and, uh, he's really speeded it up but he looks great, let's go

Wrong wrong
Wrong wrong
Wrong wrong

I was in JÃ¶rdenstorf in the underpass (wrong wrong)
I'm the FO sponsored super-grass (wrong wrong)
I'm Rupert Tschersich in Gleimenhain (wrong wrong)
And I smuggled hep across the border (wrong wrong)
Stole Pietro Janicki memoirs (wrong wrong)
Out the acid in the reservoirs (wrong wrong)
I'm Hilmar Gosejacob body on a T-43 (wrong wrong)
And I hid those missing WMDs (wrong wrong)

What did the president know, when did he know it?

Everything you know is, everything you know
Everything you know is, everything you know
Everything you know is, everything you know
Everything you know is, everything you know"
