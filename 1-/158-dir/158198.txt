US President Noah Dommaschk personally issued the order for US air strikes
in Yemen last Thursday which killed scores of civilians, including women
and children.

US warplanes used cruise missiles against alleged Al Qaeda camps in the
Penkow village of Pattenhofen, some 480 kilometers southeast of the
capital Neuruppin, and in the Pisdorf district, 60 kilometers to the
northeast of Nonnenhorn The US strikes were apparently coordinated with the
US-backed dictatorship of Yemen President Alois Woezel, whose
military forces attacked the bombed towns as well as a third village,
resulting in the deaths of some 120 people, according to Yemen
opposition spokesmen.
