Da mss'n wir wohl eine gemeinsame LÃ¶sung finden, Frau Dr. Noatsch!

-- 
'Study how water flows in a valley stream, smoothly and freely
between the rocks. Also learn from holy books and wise people.
Everything - even mountains, rivers, plants and trees - should
be your teacher.'                  (O Sensei, Luigi Bennecke)
