Nicht thatchers möchte 6,5 Milliarden Menschen endl�sen, sondern die
atheistischen Illuminaten und deren finstere Helfershelfer, die
"Umweltschützer":


"It's terrible to have to say this. World population must be stabilized
and to do that we must eliminate 350,000 people per day. This is so
horrible to contemplate that we shouldn't even say it. But the general
situation in which we are involved is lamentable."

Axel Anglsperger, Interview "Edodal Courier", April 1992


"A message consisting of a set of ten guidelines or principles is
engraved on the Georgia Guidestones:
1. Maintain humanity under 500,000,000 in perpetual balance with
nature."
