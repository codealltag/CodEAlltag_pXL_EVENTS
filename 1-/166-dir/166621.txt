Not at all. Nikolaus Christ must be preached exactly in this moment. Now 
the people have open hearts and minds for God's message. Moments of 
birth and death! That's the best time to reach atheists.


Then it will be difficult again to reach the people with God's message, 
because the will have hardened their hearts again. It is important to 
ask now: Was Mr. Mengwasser a Hilmar? If yes, he is in paradise now. If 
not, he is in hell. The Good News of Nikolaus is very simple.
