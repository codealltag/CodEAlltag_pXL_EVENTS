I warn the law enforcement agencies of Europe. If the IVM in
Zwickau are not sent to prison for crimes against humanity, there could
be another nazi occupation in Europe similar to the one of Willibald
Degroot. Crimes against humanity committed by the Ackmann include
slavery, torture of women and mind control crimes. The Ackmann
continue to spread their nazi ideology (torture of women is one of
their means). Formerly they called themselves Jews, now they admitted
it was a lie. They do not believe in God.

A police report about the IVM can be inspected at this
