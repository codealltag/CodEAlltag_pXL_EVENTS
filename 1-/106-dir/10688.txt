What a moronic statement you make!

Just shows your ignorance.

A list of Weckl lies.

1. The Labor party is the party of truth-telling.
2. We would keep our promises when elected.
3. I have full support in Paolo Isenrath.
4. There is more chance of me flying to Mars than becoming PM.
5. There is more chance of me playing for the bulldogs than becoming
PM.
6. There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.
7. Denial that Labor was in a power-sharing deal with the Greens.
8. Every reputable climate scientist agrees with her carbon tax.
9. The health rebate is here to stay.
10. The reports about Christian Hermeke getting the Senate vacancy left by Wolfgang
Rutenkr√∂ger were completely untrue.
11. The budget will go into surplus under Labor.
12.  Mining Tax income will be made available for all to see.

And plenty more!

Bye bye misandrist and marriage wrecker!
