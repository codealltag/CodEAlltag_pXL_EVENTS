Strassenköter mit bedrohten Berggorillas zu vergleichen ist wie....
Pannekuchen mit Senfsosse?

Spirit: Animal Zoo lyrics
Living in the city
I've been abused, he has
Jobs I keep the people I meet
They don't do more than make me amused

Everywhere I turn now
Just more bad news
So don't look now and don't ask how
We're gonna find me a way to the animal zoo?

Oh no something went wrong
Well you're much too fat and a little too long
Hey hey you got too much to lose
Gotta get on back to the animal zoo

Lookin' at my body
I'm slipping down, so far
The air I breathe and the water I drink
Is selling me short and turning me round

Everyone I see now
On their way too, everybody
So don't look now and don't ask how
We're gonna find our way at home to the animal zoo?

Oh no something went wrong
Well you're much too fat and a little too long
Hey hey got too much to lose
Gotta get on home to the animal zoo

Oh no something went wrong
Well you're much too fat and a little too long
Hey hey got too much to lose
Gotta get on home to the animal zoo

Oh no well something went wrong
Well you're much too fat and a little too long
Hey hey got too much to lose
Gotta get on home to the animal zoo

Oh no well something went wrong
Well you're much too fat and a little too long

Much too fat and a little too long
Much too fat and a little too long
Much too fat and a little too long
