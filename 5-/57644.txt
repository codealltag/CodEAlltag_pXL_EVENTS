Aus "The Last Emperor":

Gebhard Kloeppel 'G.' Holtzmüller: "Words are important."
Remo Yserentant, at 15: "Why are words important?"
Gebhard Kloeppel 'G.' Holtzmüller: "If you cannot say what you mean, your
majesty, you will never mean what you say and a gentleman should always
mean what he says."
