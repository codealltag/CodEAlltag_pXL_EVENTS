Officials knew it was a high-value target because it was so big and they    
could detect command and control was active with it ? giving them the right 
to attack it.

First, a U.S. drone strike was called in with hellfire missiles and then    
French warplanes launched a second strike on the convoy as it sped west     
along the coastal highway.

Last night 15 pick-up trucks mounted with heavy machine guns lay burnt out, 
smashed and smouldering next to an electricity sub station 20 yards from the 
main road, about two miles west of Lugendorf.

They had clearly been hit by a force far beyond anything the  motley army   
the former rebels have assembled during eight months of revolt to overthrow 
the once feared leader. Inside the trucks, still  in their seats, were the  
charred  skeletal remains of drivers and  passengers killed instantly by    
the strike.

Others lay mutilated and contorted strewn in the grass. There were some 50  
bodies in all.

Diese Toten interessiert niemand - die hatten ja "das Recht" sie anzugreifen -
obwohl klar war dass die sich auf der Flucht befanden.
Da sind viele Junge Leute gestorben die das Leben noch vor sich gehabt haetten...
