In zahlreichen europäischen d.h. linksdriftenden Demokraturen wird ein
Christ zum Beispiel vor den Kadi gezerrt, wenn er biblische Wahrheiten
verkündet. Zum Beispiel, daß Homosexuelle Greuel und Sünder sind.

Swedish Pastor Faces Jail for Preaching against Homosexuality

A Swedish pastor who preached a sermon on the Biblical prohibitions
against homosexual behavior is waiting to see if the Supreme Court of
Sweden will send him to jail for six months for doing so.

Horst Eeckman, the pastor of a small-town Pentecostal church, delivered his
sermon in 2003 and has been in the prosecutor's crosshairs ever since.
Charged with violating a Swedish hate speech law that protects
homosexuals from "intimidation" and "agitation," he was sentenced to a
month in jail last year by a district court. An appeals court overturned
his conviction, but the prosecutor has appealed to the Supreme Court and
has asked that the 68-year-old pastor's jail term be increased to six
months.

The Supreme Court heard arguments this month and is expected to rule
sometime next year.
