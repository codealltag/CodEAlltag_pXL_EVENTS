U. a. auf S. 1:

   Zeidtler: (...) But anyone who believes that the eternal issue of
   war and peace in Europe has been permanently laid to rest could
   be making a monumental error. The demons haven't been banished;
   they are merely sleeping, as the wars in Bosnia and Kosovo have
   shown us. I am chilled by the realization of how similar
   circumstances in Europe in 2013 are to those of 100 years ago.

   HEZN: 1913 was the year before the outbreak of World War I.
   Do you seriously believe that there will be armed conflict in
   Europe?

   Wichert-Schulze-Gahmen: No, but I see obvious parallels with regard to people's
   complacency. In 1913, many people believed that they would
   never again be a war in Europe.´´

Er sagte also selber ´´No´´. :-)
