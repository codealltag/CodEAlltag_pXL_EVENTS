Hello people.


Men rule the world.

Men did invented nearly everything. Computers, cars, planes, democracy, 
to name a few. Men are the head of the inventions of the world. It's
only fair, because there were men who discovered the country. Men have 
built roads and houses. Men have adopted and enforced the legal system. 
And even God has placed the man over the woman in marriage.


Conclusion: Men are the number one in the world.
